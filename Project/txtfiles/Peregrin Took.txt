'''Peregrin Took''', more commonly known as '''Pippin''', was a [[hobbit]] of the [[Shire]], and one of [[Frodo Baggins]]' youngest, but closest friends. He was a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and later became the thirty-second [[Thain]] of the Shire.
== Biography ==

Pippin was born to [[Paladin II Took]] and [[Eglantine (Banks) Took|Eglantine Banks]] on the spring of [[TA 2990]] ([[SR 1390]]). He was the youngest of four children and had three older sisters, [[Pearl Took|Pearl]], [[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]], and [[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]]. His father's sister, [[Esmeralda Brandybuck|Esmeralda Took]], was the mother of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], thus making Pippin and Merry first cousins.<ref name="took">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix C]]: Family Trees, Took of Great Smials</ref>
Through his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Frodo Baggins, and the first-cousin twice-removed of Bilbo.<ref name="took" />

=== War of the Ring ===

==== Fellowship of the Ring ====
[[File:PippinByMagali.JPG|left|thumb|236x236px|Depiction of Pippin by [http://www.magali-villeneuve.com/ Magali Villeneuve] for a [https://ringsdb.com/card/06056 2013 trading card release]]]
While on their way to [[Buckland]], [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], and Peregrin Took encountered a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]], who was warded off by the presence of the company of [[Elves]], led by [[Gildor Inglorion]].<ref name="three">''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter III: "[[Three is Company]]"</ref> Meriadoc Brandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were waylaid by [[Old Man Willow]] in the [[Old Forest]],<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter VI: "[[The Old Forest]]"</ref> and [[Tom Bombadil]] rescued them and took them into his house.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter VII: "[[In the House of Tom Bombadil]]"</ref> On the way to [[Bree]], Pippin was caught up with the [[Barrow-wights]] on the [[Barrow-downs]]. After the encounter, Pippin acquired a [[Barrow-blades|Dagger of Westernesse]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter VIII: "[[Fog on the Barrow-downs]]"</ref>
In [[The Prancing Pony]], Frodo accidentally slipped the [[One Ring]] upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter IX: "[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]"</ref> Their group met a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]], [[Aragorn II Elessar|Strider]]. The inn was attacked by the [[Nazgûl]] at night, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose real name was Aragorn.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter X: "[[Strider]]"</ref>
Aragorn led them to [[Weathertop]], where the group was once again attacked by the Black Riders.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter XI: "[[A Knife in the Dark]]"</ref> In haste to get an injured Frodo to [[Rivendell]], the Elf-lord [[Glorfindel]] arrived and guided them.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter XII: "[[Flight to the Ford]]"</ref>
After the [[Council of Elrond]], Pippin and Merry were allowed by [[Elrond]] to join the Fellowship of the Ring.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book Two, Chapter II: "[[The Council of Elrond]]"</ref>
[[File:PippinMoria.jpg|thumb|250x250px|left|Pippin in Moria, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]
In [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]], Pippin thoughtlessly dropped a stone down a well, which roused goblins in various caverns and revealed the Fellowship's presence to them. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a "fool of a Took."<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book Two, Chapter IV: "[[A Journey in the Dark]]"</ref>

==== Capture by the Uruk-hai ====
During the [[Skirmish at Amon Hen]], Pippin and Merry were protected by [[Boromir]], who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away by the [[Uruk-hai]], mistaking them to be the [[Ring-bearer]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book Two, Chapter X: "[[The Breaking of the Fellowship]]"</ref> On their way to [[Isengard]], Pippin dropped the elven-brooch he received from [[Lothlórien]], as a sign for Aragorn, [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], who were in pursuit.
When a company of the [[Rohirrim]] ambushed the Uruk-hai,<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter III: "[[The Uruk-hai]]"</ref> Pippin and Merry were able to escape into [[Fangorn Forest]], where they meet the [[Ent]] [[Treebeard]]. They both drank [[Ent-draughts]] during their time in Fangorn, which increased their heights substantially.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter IV: "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]"</ref> Pippin and Merry eventually befriended Treebeard and told him what happened to them. After the [[Entmoot]], the Ents decided to march against Isengard.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter VII: "[[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]]"</ref>
Pippin and Merry were reunited with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf after the battle.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter VIII: "[[The Road to Isengard]]"</ref>

==== Guard of the Citadel ====
In [[Orthanc]], Pippin picked up the ''[[Palantír|palantír]]'', which [[Gríma Wormtongue]] threw. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter with [[Sauron]] himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the Ring-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on [[Shadowfax]] to [[Gondor]], for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter XI: "[[The Palantír]]"</ref> Pippin met [[Denethor II]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward of Gondor]] and [[Boromir]]'s father. In recompense for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor and became a [[Guard of the Citadel]].<ref name=minas>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter I: "[[Minas Tirith (chapter)|Minas Tirith]]"</ref>
[[File:Belegstoppspippin.jpg|thumb|268x268px|Pippin wearing the Citadel Guard livery in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'']]
While in [[Minas Tirith]], Pippin befriended [[Beregond (Captain)|Beregond]], a fellow Guard of the Citadel, his son [[Bergil]] and [[Faramir]], Boromir's younger brother. During the [[Siege of Gondor]], Pippin witnessed Denethor preparing a pyre in the [[Hallows]] for himself and an unconscious Faramir. Pippin quickly went out in search for Gandalf, with whom he was able to save Faramir from being burned to death. Denethor, however, burned to death in the pyre he had made.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter VI: "[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]"</ref>

==== Last days of the war ====
Pippin was among the army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They assaulted the [[Black Gate]] to divert the attention of Sauron and give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the [[Battle of the Black Gate]], Pippin managed to kill one of the [[Olog-hai]], a troll-race bred by Sauron, the first hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll fell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and brought him to the healers, saving his life.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter X: "[[The Black Gate Opens]]"</ref> After his coronation, King Elessar knighted him and granted him and his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces during the [[Scouring of the Shire]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref>

=== After the war ===

In the year [[FO 6]] of the Fourth Age Pippin married [[Diamond Took|Diamond of Long Cleeve]], when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, [[Faramir Took]], who later married [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s daughter [[Goldilocks (Gardner) Took|Goldilocks Gardner]].<ref name="chiefdays">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Chief Days from the Fall of Barad-dûr to the End of the Third Age"</ref>
In the year [[FO 13]], Pippin became the 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position he held for 50 years before renouncing it in [[FO 63]], when he revisited Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.<ref name="chiefdays" />
Pippin died some time after the year FO 63 and was laid to rest with Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar (Aragorn) died in [[FO 120]], Merry and Pippin were entombed next to him.

== Etymology ==

The name '''''Peregrin''''' was derived from the Latin word ''peregrinus'' ("pilgrim").<ref>''An Introduction to Elvish'', The Giving of Names</ref>

'''Razanur Tûk''' was the [[Westron]] of ''Pippin'', from ''raza'' ("stranger") and ''razan'' ("foreign"). It was a name of a legendary traveller.<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XII: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', II: "The Appendix on Languages"</ref>

=== Titles ===

*'''Thain Peregrin I''' - Pippin's title when he became a [[Thain]] of the Shire<ref name="took" />
*'''''Ernil i Pheriannath''''' - [[Sindarin]] for "Prince of the Halflings"; given to Pippin by the people of Minas Tirith<ref name="minas" />
*'''Guard of the Citadel''' - Given to him by [[Denethor II]], [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward of Gondor]]
*'''Knight of Gondor''' - Given by King [[Aragorn II Elessar]]<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter VI: "[[Many Partings]]"</ref>
*'''Counsellor of the North-kingdom''' - Granted to him when he became Thain of the Shire<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "Later Events concerning the Members of the Fellowship of the Ring"</ref>

== Character ==
The hair on his head and his feet (which are exceptionally hairy, even for a [[Hobbit]]) was almost golden and curly. At the beginning of [[Quest of the Ring]], he was smaller than the rest of the Hobbits because he was the youngest. But after he and Merry drank the [[Ent-draughts|draught]] from Treebeard, they became some of the tallest hobbits in history, towering at over four and a half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become very expensive. In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', he was a worthy accomplice to Merry's plans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a sometimes thoughtless Hobbit, and seemingly had a knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' he becomes increasingly mature and courageous.

[[File:Screen Shot 2016-08-11 at 1.01.20 PM.png|thumb|220x220px|"..but what about ''second'' breakfast?"]]
== Weapons ==

Pippin, like Merry, used a [[Barrow-blades|sword]] of the [[Westernesse]] he obtained from the Barrow-downs. When he arrived at Minas Tirith, he gained a sword that he later referred to as a "troll's bane."

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings ===
[[File:Ralph Bakshi's Peregrin.PNG|thumb|Peregrin Took (1978)]]
Dominic Guard voiced Meriadoc, in Ralph Bakshi’s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]].

=== Rankin/Bass's Return of the King ===
[[File:Rankin-Bass's Peregrin.PNG|thumb|Peregrin Took (1980)]]
Sonny Melendrez voiced the character of Meriadoc in Rankin/Bass's 1980 animated short of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]''.

=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===
In the [[Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], Pippin is played by [[Billy Boyd]], who is the oldest of the actors portraying the four protagonist Hobbits ([[Elijah Wood|Elijah Wood]], who plays Frodo, is the youngest).

Pippin's foolish acts are mainly for comedic relief. Generally weaker than the rest, he does overcome his foolishness and becomes of much use in [[The Return of the King (film)|''The Return of the King''.]]

In the films, Pippin loses his sword given by [[Aragorn]] at [[Weathertop]], and later receives a short sword of Gondor, and the helmet and livery of the [[Guard of the Citadel|Citadel Guard]].
