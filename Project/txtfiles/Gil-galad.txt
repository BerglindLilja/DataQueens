'''Gil-galad''', born '''Ereinion''', was a [[Ñoldor]]in [[Elf]] and son to [[Fingon]]<ref group="note">Even though Gil-Galad was mentioned in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as the son of [[Fingon]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated after its publication that this was a mistake, and that Gil-galad was actually '''[[Orodreth]]'''<nowiki/>'s son'''.'''</ref>. He was the last [[High King of the Ñoldor]] in [[Middle-earth]], and bore many titles, including '''High King of the Elves of the West''', King of the Eldar, King of Lindon, Lord of the High Elves, and the Lord of Eriador.

Gil-galad held the highest authority among the Elves he ruled and was respected by both the Ñoldor and the Sindar, thus being considered a "High King" of Elves in [[Middle-earth]]. He formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] with [[Elendil]], and led the Elves to war against Sauron during this time. His death marked the end of the [[Ñoldor|Ñoldorin]] Kingdoms in Middle-earth, though some Ñoldor would still dwell in [[Rivendell|Imladris]] and the [[Grey Havens]] throughout the Third Age.

== History ==
=== First Age ===

Gil-galad was most likely born in the fifth century of the [[First Age]], and was still young during the times of the battles of the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad]]. He was the son of Fingon, tying him into the House of Fingolfin. He lived in [[Nargothrond]] until its fall and escaped to the [[Isle of Balar]].

After the death of [[Turgon]] during the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Gil-galad received the Kingship of the [[Ñoldor]].<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Quenta Silmarillion]],'' Chapter XXIV: "[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]"</ref> When the [[Sons of Fëanor]] committed the [[Third Kinslaying]], Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Sons of Fëanor, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]' captivity. After the [[War of Wrath]], the remaining Sons of Fëanor vanished out of history. [[Maedhros]] committed suicide while [[Maglor]] disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks as his herald, after the latter chose to be one of Elf-kind.

=== Second Age ===
[[File:GILGALAD.jpg|left|thumb|227x227px|Gil-galad, by [http://lelia.deviantart.com Lelia]]]

In year [[SA 1|1]] of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established a realm in [[Lindon]], which was geographically strong and secure against enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the [[Misty Mountains]] and the western parts of [[Greenwood the Great]], though most of the [[Eldar]] remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of [[Rivendell]].

Gil-galad had an alliance with the [[Númenóreans|Men of Westernesse]], especially with [[Tar-Aldarion]] (the Mariner), [[The Faithful]] and [[Elendil]]. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the [[Second Age]]. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or [[Mallorn]], trees by Tar-Aldarion, [[King of Númenor]]. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to [[Galadriel]] before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in [[Lothlórien|Lindórinand]]. When they grew there it was renamed Laurelindórenan, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called [[Sauron|Annatar]], who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.

However Annatar was received in [[Eregion]], where he taught the Elves how to make the [[Rings of Power]]. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted by [[Celebrimbor]] with the Elven Rings [[Vilya]] (Ring of Air) and [[Narya]] (Ring of Fire), two of the [[Three Rings]], which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant [[Círdan]] prior to his demise in the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)</ref>

Sauron invaded [[Eriador]] in great force in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], destroying Eregion and laying siege to the [[Grey Havens]]. But Gil-galad was aided by the [[Númenóreans]], then ruled by [[Tar-Minastir]], who sent a great fleet which defeated the Dark Lord's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to [[Mordor]], where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the [[Dúnedain]]. Over a thousand years later Sauron was again confronted by the Númenóreans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the [[Akallabêth|ruin of Númenor]]. Yet the survivors of Númenor, known as the [[The Faithful]], arrived in Middle-Earth and established the [[Realms in Exile]], with Gil-galad befriending the High King [[Elendil]] and building for him the the three towers on the [[Tower Hills]]. A century later when Sauron attacked [[Gondor]], Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with him. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength, forming the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]].

The two kings spent several years training and assembling their forces before meeting at [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]]. Crossing the [[Misty Mountains]] they were joined by [[Oropher]] of the [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]], [[Amdír]] of Lórien and [[Dwarves named "Durin"|Durin]] IV of [[Khazad-dûm]]. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named [[Aeglos]] - which meant "Icicle"; none could withstand it. Joining up with the army of Gondor led by [[Anárion]], the Army of the Last Alliance confronted Sauron's forces in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], a long and bloody battle which ultimately resulted in victory for the Alliance. The [[Elves]] and [[Men]] then passed through into Mordor and laid siege to [[Barad-dûr]] for seven years.

Eventually Sauron emerged and Gil-galad and Elendil then duelled the Dark Lord. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the [[Dark Lord]] to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed [[Isildur]] to sever the [[One Ring|Ring]] from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from "the heat of Sauron's hand", and so he passed on to the [[Halls of Mandos]]. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in Middle-earth and [[Círdan]] was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]: [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''</ref>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.
</poem>

:― From ''[[The Fall of Gil-galad]]'', as translated by Bilbo Baggins<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter XI: "[[A Knife in the Dark]]"</ref><ref group="note">The poem apparently goes on longer, but the remainder was mainly about Mordor, and was therefore not recited because Sam didn't think he'd be going there himself.</ref>

== Etymology ==

'''''Gil-galad''''' was [[Sindarin]] for "Star of Radiance"<ref name="index">''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Index of Names</ref>, from ''gil'' ("star") and ''galad'' ("light, radiance").<ref>''[[Parma Eldalamberon|Parma Eldalamberon 17]]'', Words, Phrases and Passages in Various Tongues in ''The Lord of the Rings'' by J.R.R. Tolkien</ref>

His name in [[Quenya]] was '''''Artanáro''''' which means "High Flame". In Sindarin, ''Artanáro'' translates to ''Rodnor''.<ref name="parentage" />

It was first conceived that Gil-galad's birth name was '''''Ereinion''''' instead of his epessë.<ref name="ruin" /> ''Ereinion'' means "Son of Kings", from ''erain'' ("kings") and ''ion'' ("son").<ref name="index" /><ref>''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol. V: ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part Three: "[[The Etymologies]]"</ref>

== Parentage ==
Gil-galad's parentage had many versions in Tolkien's [[Tolkien Mythology|legendarium]]:

*Gil-galad was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of [[Fëanor]].

*In both ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', he was the son of [[Fingon]].<ref name="ruin">''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Chapter XVIII: "[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]"</ref>

*In some notes in ''[[History of Middle-earth|The History of Middle-earth]]'', it is stated that he had briefly been the son of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. It was said that Felagund sent his wife and son away to the [[Falas]] for their safety. In this version, [[Galadriel]] was Gil-galad's sister and daughter of Felagund.<ref name="parentage">''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XII: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', chapter XI: "[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]", Parentage of Gil-galad</ref> However, Tolkien ultimately decided that Felagund was unmarried and childless.

*In another, [[Angrod]] had a son Artaresto (later called [[Orodreth]]) whom Finrod made his steward and succeeded in [[Nargothrond]]. His wife was a [[Sindarin]] lady of the North, and had two children, [[Finduilas]] and Gil-galad, whom she called Rodnor.<ref name="parentage" />

*In the last, the name ''Artaresto'' was replaced by ''Arothir'' (Orodreth), which was the name of the nephew of Finrod and father of Gil-galad. Finduilas remained as Orodreth's daughter and became sister of Gil-galad.<ref name="parentage" />

[[File:Gil-galad_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Gil-galad at the end of the Second Age]]

A marginal note by [[Tolkien]] from around this time (the late 1950s) suggested that Gil-galad might have been the son of Fingon. This suggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor [[Christopher Tolkien]] in the published version of ''The Silmarillion'', which states that Gil-galad is the son of Fingon. After the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and the ruin of Beleriand which resulted in the death of his grandfather [[Fingolfin]], then High King of the Ñoldor, Fingon becomes the High King and sends a young Gil-galad to the Havens of the [[Falas]] under [[Círdan]].<ref name="ruin" /> This idea of Gil-galad being sent to the Havens was derived from material which the elder Tolkien had written at the time when he saw Gil-galad as the son of Finrod.

After the disaster of the [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad]], the title passes to Fingon's brother [[Turgon]]. [[Melkor|Morgoth]] assaults the [[Falathrim]] in great force after that battle but Círdan and Gil-galad manage to flee in their ships to the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of [[Gondolin]] and the death of Turgon, Gil-galad becomes the King. Gil-galad's name in the chapter "[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife|Aldarion and Erendis]]" in ''Unfinished Tales'' was also changed by the younger Tolkien in order to keep consistency with the published version of ''The Silmarillion''. — in the original version of that work he was noted as a son of Finrod. Christopher later stated in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' that this decision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on his part, and did not represent his father's conception of the character. He suggested that it would have been better to have left Gil-galad's parentage obscure.

Tolkien's final decision for Gil-galad's parentage appears to have been that he was a son of Orodreth, who was at the same time changed from being a son of [[Finarfin]] to a son of Angrod. This conception, however, was never incorporated into the written stories of ''The Silmarillion'', and aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of Angrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing text. In the official text of ''The Silmarillion'', Gil-galad receives the kingship as he is the son of Fingon, who in turn is the son of Fingolfin.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Gil-galad's (played by [[Mark Ferguson]]) death scene was deleted, however he makes a brief appearance when he fights multiple [[Orcs]] with his spear. He also appears very briefly as one of the original three Elven ring-bearers (along with [[Galadriel]] and [[Círdan]]) wearing [[Vilya]].

==== Non-canonical weapons ====
===== Armor =====

[[File:Gilgalad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gil-galad's armor and spear Aeglos in the 2001 film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.]]

Gil-galad's armor was similar in composition to that of all Elves of the [[Second Age]] (as seen in the prologue to the first film): a cuirass and fault of interlocking lames of steel plate over a hauberk of fine mail, together with pauldrons and braces. However, befitting his status as High-king, his armor was blued and etched with vine like tracery, and the plates were embossed with [[Tengwar]] symbols and included leather pants, which gave greater protection. At the throat, he wore a steel collar that bore his heraldic insignia, twelve stars on a midnight blue field. The color blue may have reflected an association with the sea; in any case, it was certainly a dye that was rare on [[Middle-earth]], and it would have required a great deal of time and knowledge to locate enough flora or fauna with which to make it. His cloak was of a deep blue and his armor was golden, and instead of a helmet, he wore a golden crown, fashioned for him by [[Celebrimbor]], who made the [[Rings of Power]].

===== Shield =====
[[File:Shield.jpg|thumb|150px|The shield of Gil-galad]]

The shield of the High-king was the same shape as the common Elven shield, but like his armor it was more richly adorned: it was enameled in blue on and around the center jewel and decorated in [[gold]] with the twelve stars of his house. Because [[Aeglos]], his great spear, was wielded two-handed, it is likely that the shield was carried only to the field of battle rather onto it, to be left with one of Gil-galad's attendants. It may have been used by him when he fought with a sword.

=== Video games ===
[[File:Gil-galad - LOTRO.jpg|thumb|Gil-galad in ''The Lord of the Rings Online''|alt=]]
* In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Gil-galad appears in several flashbacks depicting the the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than the film version, showing [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad both battling and defeating [[Sauron]] at the cost of their lives.
*In ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', after Talion finds a certain artifact, the stone from Mount Doom, Celebrimbor will state that he "watched Gil-galad die on the slopes of Mount Doom". This implies that he watched the battle from the wraith-world, where his soul resides in the game's internal canon. In that game's sequel, [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War|Shadow of War]], Talion and Celebrimbor will use his spear, likely retrieving it from his resting place.
*Gil-galad is a playable character in ''[[LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'', and can be obtained by finding him and buying him in a cave in Mordor. He is styled after the movie interpretation of Gil-galad, but his equipment does not include a spear; he instead wields an Elven sword and shield.
