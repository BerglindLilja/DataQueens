      "Théoden was the only son of [[Thengel]], and became king after the death of his father in [[TA 2980]]. Théoden spoke [[Sindarin]] and [[Westron]] more often than [[Rohirric]], due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of his youth growing up in the mountain vales of [[Gondor]], his mother's homeland.<ref name=\"eorl\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister [[Théodwyn]] lived with him in [[Edoras]], and after she and her husband both died he adopted her children [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]] as his own. He had a son [[Théodred]], whose mother [[Elfhild]] died in childbirth.<ref name=\"eorl\" />\n",

      "By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Théoden had been king for nearly 40 years, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his chief adviser [[Gríma Wormtongue|Gríma]] (or ''Wormtongue'' as most others in the [[Rohan|Mark]] called him), who was secretly in the employ of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]]. Gríma may even have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained an increasingly large hold over him. [[Rohan]] had been troubled by [[Orc]]s and [[Dunlendings]] since the time of his father and now by the new fighting [[Uruk-hai]], who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from [[Isengard]].<ref name=\"golden\" />\n",
      "\n",
      "When Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at the [[Battles of the Fords of Isen|First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer became his heir. Éomer however fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was placed under arrest.\n",
      "[[File:Theoden with Herugrim - TtT.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Théoden upon reclaiming his sword, Herugrim]]\n",
      "When [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]], [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] appeared before him, Théoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded [[Háma]] to release his nephew and bring him his [[Herugrim|sword]]. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf, advanced to face the invasion by the forces of Saruman. However on meeting [[Ceorl]] on the road and realising the strength of Isengard he rode instead to the fortress of the [[Hornburg]], and shortly thereafter successfully defended the keep at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] despite overwhelming odds. After this, he became known as '''Théoden Ednew''', the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the battle, Théoden came with Gandalf to the ruins of Isengard, where he met [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. He soon made a favorite of Merry, and expressed great interest in hearing more about the [[Shire]], especially [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] lore surrounding [[pipe-weed]]. Riding to [[Dunharrow]] via mountain paths, Théoden arrived to find the muster of the Rohirrim in full swing. That night, errand riders from [[Gondor]] arrived and presented him with the [[Red Arrow]], a symbol of dire need and summons to fulfil the [[Oath of Eorl]]. \n",

      "Théoden then led six thousand Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], bravely charging the legions of [[Sauron]], where he won great glory by defeating a chieftain of the [[Southrons]] bearing the banner of the [[Black Serpent]] in single combat.<ref name=\"pelennor\">''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter VI: \"[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]\"</ref>\n",

      "Théoden, portrayed by [[Bernard Hill]], is a major character and secondary protagonist in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Lord of the Rings film trilogy|film trilogy]]. He appears in ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]''. Théoden is depicted as a considerate leader and mighty warrior who does not believe that Sauron can be defeated; however, he wishes to die with honor and make him and his people \"worthy of remembrance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In ''The Two Towers'', Théoden is initially outright possessed by [[Saruman]], in a deviation from the books. While under Saruman's spell, Théoden appears extremely aged, with grey hair and glassy eyes, and is unwilling to defend [[Rohan]] from the [[Dunlendings]] and [[Uruk-hai]] pillaging the [[Westfold]]. After Théoden's son [[Théodred]] is killed by orcs, the new heir [[Éomer]] is banished by Wormtongue (on \"orders\" of the king) from Edoras; he takes with him some 2,000 Rohirrim riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Edoras and Gandalf frees Théoden from Saruman's spell. The king recovers his sanity and a healthy appearance, and banishes Gríma (though originally desiring to execute the spy). Théoden mourns his son and decides that the best way to defend his people is to evacuate Edoras to [[Helm's Deep]], a decision Gandalf criticizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ''The Two Towers'', Théoden seems unsure as to whether his countrymen can fend off Saruman's hordes. Before the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], he poetically expresses his belief that the world of men is soon to be destroyed. As the Uruk-hai overwhelm the fortress, he seems resigned to his fate; when he \"rides out\" with Aragorn on a final suicide charge, it is more so in order to die with honor than to actually defeat the Uruk-hai. However, Gandalf arrives during their charge and liberates Helm's Deep. The victors ride to [[Isengard]] to challenge Saruman, only to find the Ents have already defeated his forces and sealed him in his tower. Saruman attempts to persuade Théoden to make peace with him, but the king rejects him. Seeing Gríma atop [[Orthanc]], he offers to grant him clemency, but as the former man of Rohan wavers, Saruman strikes him down. In revenge, Gríma stabs his master in the back before being felled by [[Legolas]]' arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "By ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'', Théoden has become more confident in himself and his people. He boldly declares that Rohan will answer [[Gondor]]'s call for aid once the [[Beacons]] of Minas Tirith are lit, and he assembles an army of 6,000 riders to liberate Gondor from [[Mordor]]'s armies. Though he does not believe that his men can actually defeat Sauron, he inspires the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid for the sake of honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Théoden leads the Rohirrim in their charge against the Orcish armies. The Rohirrim largely defeat the Orcs only to face a greater challenge in [[Harad]]'s [[Mûmakil]]. Théoden's riders appear well on the way to victory when the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] arrives and throws Théoden from his steed. The king is crushed beneath his horse, and is about to be eaten by the Witch-King's [[Fellbeast]] when [[Éowyn]] intervenes. Théoden lives long enough to witness his niece kill the Witch-King before succumbing to his injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the epilogue, it is suggested that [[Éomer]] ascends to the throne of Rohan, although at one point in the film Théoden suggests that Éowyn should rule if anything were to happen to him. (Likely under the assumption that if he dies in Gondor, Éomer will be dead with him.)\n",
