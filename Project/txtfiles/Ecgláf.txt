'''Ecgláf''' was an elderly, brave farmer who lived in [[Rohan]]. After taking refuge in the [[Hornburg]], he was forced to fight and defend the fortress from an army of [[Uruk-hai]]. He was seen inside the armory where he was standing in line and given a spear by a Rohirrim soldier. He fought in the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], and it is possible that he was one of the many combatants that were killed.

His character was created for [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'']] and as such is non-canonical.
