'''Elrond''' ([[Sindarin]]; [[IPA charts|IPA]]: "Star-Dome") [[Half-elven]], [[Lord of Rivendell]], was one of the mighty Elf-rulers of old who lived in [[Middle-earth]] from the [[First Age]] to the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]]. He was the father of [[Elladan and Elrohir]] and [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]], the eventual wife of [[Aragorn II Elessar]].

== Biography ==
=== First Age ===
[[File:Little half elven by tuuliky.jpg|left|thumb|288x288px|Maglor raising Elrond by Tuuliky]]
Elrond [[Half-elven]] was the son of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], and a great-grandson of [[Lúthien]]. He was born in the refuge of the [[Havens of Sirion]] in [[Beleriand]] late in the [[First Age]], soon before its sack by the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. Elrond and his twin brother [[Elros]] were captured and raised by [[Maglor]] a [[Sons of Fëanor|son of Fëanor]]. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Chapter XXIV: "[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]"</ref> By the end of the First Age and the [[War of Wrath]], the Sons of Fëanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to [[Lindon]].
  	
=== Second Age ===
	  	
Elrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be counted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became [[Elros|Elros Tar-Minyatur]], the first [[King of Númenor]]. Elrond chose to be counted among the Elves,<ref>''The Silmarillion, [[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)</ref> and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of [[Gil-Galad]], the [[High King of the Ñoldor]].<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Two, IV: "The History of Galadriel and Celeborn"</ref>

With the start of the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] in [[SA 1695]], Elrond was sent to [[Eregion]] by [[Gil-galad]] in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of [[Sauron]]. Unfortunately, Elrond's host arrived too late and was not large enough on its own to defeat off [[Sauron]]'s army. He retreated north with the refugees of [[Eregion]] including [[Celeborn]], only escaping because the forces of [[Dwarves named "Durin"|Durin III]] assailed Sauron's army in the rear. It was during the following two years ([[SA 1697]]) that Elrond founded [[Rivendell]] at the feet of the [[Misty Mountains]], as a sanctuary and stronghold. For the next four years Rivendell was [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]] by Sauron's forces.
	 
With the arrival of the [[Númenóreans]] the army besieging Rivendell was caught between the forces of Gil-galad and Elrond and destroyed. Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first [[White Council]], attended by [[Galadriel]], at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the [[Three Rings]] then held by Gil-galad and Galadriel would remain hidden. According to one account Gil-galad at this time gave Elrond [[Vilya]] the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-Galad kept both [[Narya]] and [[Vilya]] until the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met [[Celebrían]], the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.
	 	
[[File:Elrond's_armor_-_halfbody.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Elrond in battle during the War of the Last Alliance in the Second Age]]
	 	
Near the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-galad in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], which set out from [[Rivendell]] to [[Mordor]] in [[SA 3431]]. Elrond was [[Gil-galad]]'s herald during the [[War of the Last Alliance|war]] against [[Sauron]]. The Alliance, which also included elves from [[Lorien]], men from [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and [[Dwarves]] led by [[Durin|Durin lV]], eventually defeated [[Sauron]]'s army and laid siege to [[Barad-dûr]] for seven years. Eventually, [[Sauron]] himself was defeated by [[Elendil]] and [[Gil-galad]], allowing [[Isildur]] to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.
	
The war took a toll on the forces of both Elves and Men. Gil-galad, [[Elendil]], and his younger son [[Anárion]] were killed in the siege. Elrond and [[Cirdan]] only remained as the commanders of the Elves, and [[Isildur]] as High King of the [[Realms in Exile]]. Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the [[One Ring]] for himself, Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of [[Mount Doom]], but the seduction of the ring made Isildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a [[Weregild]] for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the [[One Ring]]) acknowledged his claim. Elrond then returned to [[Rivendell]] at the end of the war.<ref name="rings">''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref>

=== Third Age ===
[[File:Elrond_in_Rivendell_-_The_Hobbit.jpg|thumb|250px|Elrond in Rivendell at the time of the [[Quest of Erebor]]]]

In the year [[TA 109]], Elrond wedded [[Celebrían]]. In the year [[TA 130]], the twins [[Elladan and Elrohir]] were born, and in [[TA 241]] a daughter, [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]]. Elrond lost Celebrían in [[TA 2510]] when she was waylaid by Orcs crossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the [[Undying Lands]].<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (iii): "Eriador, Arnor, and the Heirs of Isildur"</ref><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Third Age"</ref>

In the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of Isildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn son of Arathorn II]], whom he took in and fostered as his own after his father died in [[TA 2933]]. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult future gave him the name Estel, [[Sindarin]] for hope. Aragorn grew up in Imladris unaware of his royal lineage until Elrond told him when he had reached his manhood.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (v): "The tale of Aragorn and Arwen"</ref>

He also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in Rivendell, and was a great friend of [[Gandalf the Grey]]. He helped [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s [[Thorin and Company|expedition]] to retake the [[Lonely Mountain]] by discovering and translating the [[Moon-letters|Moon Writing]] on Thorin's [[Thrór's Map|map]].<ref>''[[The Hobbit]], Chapter III: "[[A Short Rest]]"''</ref>

After [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent out riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these, [[Glorfindel]], successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter XII: "[[Flight to the Ford]]"</ref> On [[October 25]], [[3018]] he held the [[The Council of Elrond|Council]] at which it was decided to attempt to destroy the [[One Ring]]. He appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book Two, Chapter II: "[[The Council of Elrond]]"</ref>

Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the [[Rangers of the North]] to [[Rohan]]. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter II: "[[The Passing of the Gray Company]]"</ref>

[[File:Elves_head_to_Valinor.png|thumb|260px|Elrond departs Middle-earth]]

Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the [[One Ring]] and of Sauron, after which he went to [[Minas Tirith]] to surrender the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] to [[King Elessar]] and give his daughter [[Arwen Undómiel]] away to be married.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter V: "[[The Steward and the King]]"</ref> On [[September 29]], [[TA 3021|3021]], Elrond left Middle-earth to go over the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter IX: "[[The Grey Havens]]"</ref>

== Etymology ==

'''''Elrond''''' is a [[Sindarin]] name that means "Star-dome" or "Elf of the cave", from ''el'' ("Elf" or "star", interchangeably) and ''rond'' ("cave, vault").<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Index of Names</ref><ref>''The Silmarillion'', Appendix: Elements in Quenya and Sindarin names</ref><ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 12: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', XII: "The Problem of Ros"</ref>

== Character ==

Elrond was a skillful warrior in battle and had commanded various armies of the Free Peoples well, including the Last Alliance. He was just as effective at leadership and gave much wise counsel. He had the gift of foresight through which he could view lands and events far away from Rivendell. He was also adept at healing others, though whether through medical knowledge or magic isn't known. The latter may be more probable in that Elrond managed to cure a Morgul wound, something which is almost invariably fatal due to its association with dark sorcery. While it is unknown just how powerful Elrond is compared to other Elf Lords, he certainly holds vast potential, being descended from the angelic Maia Melian and being the wielder of the ring of power Vilya. A notable demonstration includes Elrond summoning a great flood on the River Bruinen to sweep away the Nazgûl. Elrond was also familiar with ósanwe, the skill of entering others' minds. After the destruction of the One Ring Elrond communicated mentally with Galadriel and Gandalf on their return journey from Minas Tirith.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter VI: "[[Many Partings]]"</ref>

Elrond was one of the most incorruptible of leaders of Middle-earth. Aragorn speculated that among the few capable of completely resisting Saruman's power of speech were Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf. Elrond also rejected and opposed Sauron when the latter offered partnership with the Elves.

{{Quote|I was there, Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago, when Isildur took the ring. I was there the day the strength of Men failed.|Elrond in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''}}

Elrond appears extensively in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|film trilogy]]. He appears in all three films, portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]].

Jackson's characterization of Elrond departs in several ways from Tolkien's own. Like the other elves, Elrond is somewhat aloof in the films. He distrusts the race of men, although he knows that the time of the elves is over. In a significant change from the books, he is distressed at the thought of Arwen becoming mortal for the sake of Aragorn, and initially suggests she leave Middle-earth for Valinor. Though wise and virtuous, Jackson's Elrond appears unconvinced that Sauron can be defeated. Some have drawn similarities between Jackson's portrayal of the elves, and of Elrond in particular, and the portrayal of the highly rational Vulcan race in ''Star Trek'', or to Tolkien's own characterization of the elf [[Thingol]], who does not appear in the films.   

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Elrond is first seen in the prologue at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] as a lieutenant of the [[Ñoldor]]. He later appears in Rivendell, having summoned [[Council of Elrond|a council]] of men, dwarves, and elves to decide the fate of the [[One Ring]]. After some heated discussion, Elrond declares that the Ring must be destroyed in [[Mount Doom]]. Frodo volunteers to be the [[Ring-bearer]], and Elrond titles Frodo and his companions the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. Elrond also recounts a flashback to Gandalf in which he witnesses [[Isildur]]'s refusal to destroy the Ring, an event that makes Elrond forever suspicious of men. 

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', Elrond tries to convince Arwen to choose immortality and depart for Valinor, where her love for Aragorn may "bloom evergreen." After Elrond tells Arwen that he has foreseen her widowhood and eventual death, she emotionally agrees to take his father's counsel and leave Middle-earth. Later in the film, Elrond communicates telepathically with [[Galadriel]] regarding the fate of [[Rohan]]. He agrees to send a contingent of elvish warriors to aid [[Théoden]]'s men at [[Helm's Deep]]. (Strangely, the elves that arrive at Helm's Deep near the beginning of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] are from [[Lothlórien]], not Rivendell.)

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'', Arwen confronts Elrond early in the film after witnessing a vision of her own future son, [[Eldarion]]. Realizing that Arwen's love for Aragorn cannot be overcome, Elrond agrees to reforge [[Narsil]], the sword of [[Elendil]], into [[Andúril]]. Later, Elrond delivers Andúril to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]], and urges him to reclaim the throne of Gondor and take command of the [[Army of the Dead]]. Elrond does not appear again until the film's epilogue, where he presents Arwen to Aragorn at the latter's coronation. Elrond appears one last time at the [[Grey Havens]], where he departs Middle-earth with Gandalf, Celeborn, Galadriel, Bilbo, and Frodo.

===''The Hobbit'' film trilogy ===

[[File:BOTFA - Elrond in armor.png|thumb|left|200px|Elrond as he appears in ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'']]

Hugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond in Jackson's ''[[The Hobbit film trilogy|The Hobbit]]'' trilogy, appearing in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first]] and [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|third]] installments. His role is expanded from his brief appearance in Tolkien's [[The Hobbit|original novel]].

Elrond initially appears in ''An Unexpected Journey'' when the elves of Rivendell ambush the Warg-riders chasing Thorin and Company. Elrond wields [[Hadhafang]] (Arwen's sword in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'') and is accompanied by [[Lindir]]. He warmly welcomes Gandalf and Thorin into Rivendell and identifies their respective swords, Glamdring, Orcrist and the morgul-blade.

When Elrond inquires as to why they were journeying on the Great East Road, Gandalf persuades Thorin to show Elrond the map of Erebor. Thorin is reluctant, but in his desperation he hands Elrond the map. Elrond realizes that the writing is written in moon runes. He holds the map under the moonlight and translates the ancient writing, revealing the secret passage into the Lonely Mountain. He then deduces that Thorin intends to enter the mountain and reclaim the treasure. Elrond is skeptical of the dwarves' ability to succeed, knowing of the sickness Thorin's grandfather [[Thrór|Thror]] developed that attracted Smaug in the first place.
 
Elrond feels that Gandalf should explain Thorin's quest to the White Council, and the two meet with [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman]]. Elrond at first is doubtful of Gandalf's warnings about the possibility of [[Sauron]]'s return, but when Gandalf reveals the [[Morgul-blade]] from Dol Goldur, Elrond is horrified. He explains that the [[High Fells of Rhudaur|tombs]] of the ''Nazgûl'' are protected by powerful spells. He is then notified by Lindir that the dwarves have left Rivendell.

Elrond reappears in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' where he, Saruman and Galadriel rescue Gandalf from Dol Guldur. Elrond and Saruman reveal themselves just as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded by the specters of the ''Nazgûl''. Elrond quips they should have remained dead before he subsequently duels with them, visibly wielding his ring Vilya. He notably holds his own against several wraiths at once, before they are all defeated. He attempts to defend Galadriel as Sauron manifests before them, along with all of the Nine. Elrond then watches on in amazement as Galadriel takes on a terrifying form to repel Sauron. After Sauron and the ''Nazgûl'' are cast into the East, Elrond urges a pursuit of Sauron, to warn Gondor of his return that they must set up a watch on Mordor. Saruman denies it and instructs Elrond to take Galadriel back to Lothlórien, promising to pursue Sauron himself.

[[File:Elrond-LOTRO.jpg|thumb|250px|Elrond as portrayed in [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]]]

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Elrond makes his first appearance in the game if the player selects to play an Elf. Elrond is with the player as the Dwarves attack. He gives the character items that vary depending on the character's class. After this, he brings the player to another room where the player's master/teacher is waiting. After a brief tutorial battle between the player and the teacher Elrond tells the pair to go out to confront the enemy while he hides the relics sought by the Dwarves.

Elrond next makes an appearance when the player's character returns to the shrine, just before it collapses on their former master. Elrond is outside and tries to comfort the player character, saying that "you can blame his death on me". He remarks on what they have just witnessed before the screen fades to black and the game advances in time by 600 years.

Thereafter, Elrond is a frequent quest-giver and an active participant in the epic story-line in the game.

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', Elrond is a playable warrior in the instant action mod for Rivendell and the Hero Arena at the Black Gate. He has a long elvish blade and an elvish throwing axe, similar to the other Elven warriors. Tsunami Blade, River of Bruinen, and Water Sphere are his special abilities. He is the narrator for both campaigns. In the evil campaign, Elrond is seen during the Rivendell mission. He can be killed by Uruk-hai, or by Sauron himself. It is said that Elrond is a king, and the player must obtain his ring of power after his death. However, at the end, he returns and must be killed again, together with [[Legolas]].

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-Earth II]]'', Elrond is a hero of the Elf faction. His powers include two healing spells: Athelas, which heals himself and all nearby heroes, and a magical spell which restores heroes' health and abilities. His most powerful spell is a whirlwind (possibly an allusion to Elrond's ring of air), which can be used to sweep the map and instantly wreak havoc upon attacking units. He is the narrator for both of the campaigns, as he does in ''Conquest. ''In the Good Campaign, Elrond is playable in the first mission, where the player must defend Rivendell. He is also playable during the last mission, when the player must destroy the fortress of Dol Guldur. In the Evil Campaign, he must be killed during the last mission at Rivendell.
