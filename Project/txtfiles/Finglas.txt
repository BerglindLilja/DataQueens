{{Quote|Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then.|Treebeard}}
'''Finglas''' ([[Sindarin]] for 'hair-leaf'), known in [[Westron]] as '''Leaflock''', was an [[Ent]] of [[Fangorn Forest]].

Finglas was one of three oldest Ents still living during the end of the [[Third Age]]. He, [[Skinbark]], and [[Treebeard]] were the only ones left of the first and eldest of the Ents in [[Middle-earth]]. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Finglas had become sleepy and "treeish" (dormant and inanimate, like a tree). He stood alone in a meadow and dozed during the summer. At first he would awake in wintertime, but eventually he remained in place year-round, preferring to remain dormant to avoid the troubles of the world.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'','' [[The Two Towers (novel)|The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Ch. IV: "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]"</ref>

== Description ==
Finglas is described as a large, abundantly-leafed tree, short, and stout of heart. He had very round feet with seven stubby toes, and could step on Orc-foes easily. There was not much more written about him, as he is not a recurring character.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
[[File:Leaflock.jpg|thumb|200px|Leaflock from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
In [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', Leaflock is portrayed as a very large, thick, and oak-like Ent. He helps besiege [[Isengard]], and put out the furnace fires of the industrial devilry of [[Saruman]] below [[Orthanc]]. He is notably seen landing on top of two Orcs, crushing and killing them instantly at the start of the siege and "smacking" two Orcs (not [[Uruk-hai]]) together some time later.

He also appears in [[The Lord of the Rings Online|''The Lord of the Rings Online'']], where he can be interacted with in Fangorn forest.
