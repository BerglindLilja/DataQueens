== Portrayal in adaptations ==

Birchseed attended the [[Entmoot]] of the [[Third Age]]. At that time, there had not been an Entmoot since the [[Second Age]]. Birchseed had a large, fat nose with a twig growing out of it. He was called "Eldar Shepherd and a "Tall Statesman". Birchseed was a Birch Ent and was royal and slender. Birchseed helped [[Treebeard]] come to the conclusion that the Ents must go to war. Together, [[Treebeard]], [[Pippin]], [[Merry]], Birchseed, and the Ents went to war against [[Saruman the White]]. The Ents were angry because Saruman was burning down their Trees. The Ents flooded Saruman's land of [[Isengard]]. Birchseed Eldar Shepherd lived in Isengard thereafter.<ref>http://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/lotr05015</ref>
