'''Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbit]] of the [[Shire]] and one of [[Frodo Baggins]] cousins and closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the [[map]]s of [[Middle-earth]]. He was also one of the nine companions of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship of the Ring]], and later became the eighth [[Master of Buckland]].

== Biography ==
Merry was born in [[TA 2982]]. He was the only child of [[Saradoc Brandybuck]] ([[TA 2940]] - [[FO 11]]) the [[Master of Buckland]], and [[Esmeralda Brandybuck|Esmeralda Took]] ([[TA 2936]] - ?), the younger sister of [[Paladin II Took]]. This made him first cousin to Paladin's son [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], who was also his closest friend.

=== War of the Ring ===

Merry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the [[One Ring]] and its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded [[Bag End]] after [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind "the Conspiracy" of [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], Pippin, [[Fredegar Bolger]] (more commonly known as "Fatty", due to his plump form) and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the [[Quest of the Ring]] began, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought [[Pony|ponies]]. As a Brandybuck he also had a key to the gate in the [[High Hay]]. This shortcut through the [[Old Forest]] served them well, because they avoided the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and met [[Tom Bombadil]], who helped them. At the [[Barrow-downs]], Merry acquired [[Barrow-blades|his sword]], a work of [[Númenor|Westernesse]].

[[File:Lotr 5.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Merry with his good friend Pippin]]

At [[Bree]], he was not present in the [[Prancing Pony]] when Frodo foolishly put on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the [[Nazgûl]] who arrived. At [[Rivendell]], he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two selected to relay news to the people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end [[Gandalf]], believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam, requested that [[Elrond]] allow the two hobbits to come along. At [[Amon Hen]] he was captured along with Pippin by a band of [[Saruman]]'s fighting [[Uruk-hai]], but he made a good account for himself, and [[Boromir]] valiantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.

After being captured by the Uruks, [[Ugluk]] crudely tried to bandage Merry's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Merry's head forever. The Uruks then gave to them an orc drink, which would keep the Hobbit alive during the fast march towards [[Isengard]]. When they neared [[Fangorn forest|Fangorn Forest,]] [[Grishnákh]] began searching them, attempting to find the [[One Ring]], which he believed they carried. Before he was able to escape with the hobbits, [[Éomer]]'s [[Éored]] attacked and all of the Orcs, including Grishnákh, were slain. During the confusion of the battle Merry and Pippin were able to escape into Fangorn Forest.

Escaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, [[Treebeard]] and the newly risen [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]] met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of [[Ent-draughts|Ent-draught]], which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Treebeard to the [[Entmoot]], and later to Isengard, he and Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here that Merry encountered King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]], and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).

Separated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to [[Gondor]], Merry swore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from his liege, he rode to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] in the care of young [[Éowyn|Dernhelm]] (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it). When the Nazgûl attacked the [[Riders of Rohan]] and Théoden was injured, Merry and Éowyn faced the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both [[Fellbeast]] and the Nazgûl alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, was one of the few [[weapon]]s able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He stabbed the Witch-king behind the knee as he was about to kill Éowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]] and recovered fully, leaving [[Minas Tirith]] to tend to the wounded Pippin at the [[Field of Cormallen]].

For his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan, knighted him and gave him the name of "Holdwine". During the [[Scouring of the Shire]], he was in the forefront of the [[Battle of Bywater]], using the [[Horn of Rohan]] presented to him by Éowyn.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''</ref>[[File:0006AC40-2CAA-1FD7-8DAB80C328EC0000.jpg|thumb]]

=== Later life ===
Upon their return he and Pippin both married. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary [[Bandobras Took|Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took]], due to their having drunk large amounts of Ent-draught. Merry married [[Estella (Bolger) Brandybuck|Estella Bolger]] some time after the end of the [[Third Age]]. He became the [[Master of Buckland]] in SR 1432 (FA 11), living at [[Brandy Hall]] and also [[Crickhollow]]. He wrote ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]].'' Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At the age of 102, Merry returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there some time after the year [[FO 63]]. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar died in [[FO 120]], he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Appendix B]], "Later Events Concerning the Members of the Fellowship of the Ring"</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
<br />

=== Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings ===
[[File:Ralph Bakshi's Meriadoc.PNG|thumb|Meriadoc Brandybuck (1978)]]
Simon Chandler voiced Meriadoc, in Ralph Bakshi’s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]].
[[File:Rankin-Bass's Meriadoc.PNG|thumb|Meriadoc Brandybuck (1980)]]

=== Rankin/Bass's Return of the King ===
Casey Kasem voiced the character of Meriadoc in Rankin/Bass's 1980 animated short of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]''. 

=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

Meriadoc Brandybuck was played by [[Dominic Monaghan]] in all three of the [[Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy]] of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Merry is very close with Pippin, having almost the same relationship as Sam and Frodo do with each other. Merry is mostly used for comedic relief, along with Pippin. His role stays mostly similar to the role he plays in the book.
