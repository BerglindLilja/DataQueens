'''Éomer''' '''Éadig''' was a [[Rohirrim|Man of Rohan]] and the eventual eighteenth [[King of Rohan]], and first of the Third Line of their kings. In the last decades of the [[War of the Ring]], Éomer was the Third [[Marshal of the Mark]].

== Biography ==

Éomer, born in [[TA 2991]], of the [[House of Eorl]], was the son of [[Éomund]], a descendant of [[Éofor]], and of [[Théodwyn]], sister of [[Theoden|Théoden]] King. In [[TA 3002]], when Éomer was eleven, Éomund was slain in battle with Orcs. Théodwyn died of grief shortly afterward. Éomund also had a daughter named [[Éowyn]], Éomer's sister. After they were orphaned Théoden adopted them as his own children.

Éomer became the third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of Men. He was honored highly and trusted by the king, and was close with his cousin [[Théodred]], son of Théoden who loved him like a brother.

His [[Éored]] hunted down the [[Uruk-hai]] that had taken [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] as they camped near [[Fangorn forest]], slaying them all. He never saw the [[Hobbits]], as they had fled during the battle. Afterwards he met [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]] on the plains of Rohan, and he lent them two horses, [[Arod]] and [[Hasufel]].

Éomer returned to [[Edoras]] and reported meeting the Ranger and his friends and allowing them to go free, a violation of the king's law. Under the poisonous advice of [[Gríma Wormtongue]], he was imprisoned by Théoden, who had grown weak, aged, and suspicious under [[Saruman|Saruman the White]]'s influence.

After Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with [[Gandalf]], the four hastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Théoden and restored him to health and vitality. Théoden freed Éomer, who offered his [[Gúthwinë|sword]] to Théoden in token of his loyalty. Théoden named Éomer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the [[Hornburg]].

At the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Éomer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and a small band of men left through a postern door at the side of the Hornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates of the Hornburg. After this attack Éomer and Aragorn attempted to return through the door when Éomer was jumped upon by several Orcs who had laid low during the assault, though Éomer was saved by Gimli, who had secretly followed him out to the gate. When the [[Deeping Wall]] was breached, Éomer and Gimli were unable to reach the fortress and instead retreated up [[Helm's Deep]] to the [[Glittering Caves]], where they held the Orcs at bay.

Afterwards he rode with Théoden, Aragorn, and [[Gandalf]] to [[Isengard]], where they were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent victory. [[Treebeard]] and his fellow [[Ents]], remained as well in order to guard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.

After this, Éomer rode with Théoden to [[Dunharrow]], where the Rohirrim were mustering. After receiving the [[Red Arrow]], Théoden agreed to gather a force to help defend the city of [[Minas Tirith]] against the impending assault by [[Mordor]]. Théoden and Éomer rallied ten thousand men, leaving four thousand behind to guard Rohan before riding to the White City. The army of Rohan managed to arrive at the [[Pelennor Fields]] just as the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]] was breached. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] Éomer fought gallantly, slaying many foes. But Théoden was fatally crushed by his horse, [[Snowmane]], after being attacked by the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king's]] Fell Beast. Coming upon their corpses, Éomer was driven to temporary madness at seeing Éowyn, his sister, among the King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the forces of Mordor. He and Aragorn later met on the battlefield and reaffirmed their loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of winning the battle.

In the battle's aftermath, Éomer attended to Éowyn in the [[Houses of Healing]], and, with Aragorn and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his sister back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as Eowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love for her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason for her to live.

Éomer became King of the Mark upon Théoden's death, and attended the final council of war before the [[Battle of the Black Gate]], where Gandalf counseled that the combined forces of Gondor and Rohan must throw a diversionary force of sufficient size against Mordor, with little chance of survival, let alone success, in the slender hope of distracting [[Sauron]] long enough to allow [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] to cross Mordor in secret and deliver the [[One Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]].  Éomer confessed that he had little understanding of the "deep matters" being discussed, but he did not need it.  For him it was enough that Aragorn and his allies had come to Rohan's aid at Helm's Deep, and therefore, Rohan would stand with Gondor in the last battle. Some riders under the command of [[Elfhelm]] remained in Minas Tirith as part of the garrison.

Following Sauron's fall, Éomer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of the kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Théoden back to his home for burial, where Éomer was formally crowned as King.

[[File:Eomer_at_the_coronation.png|thumb|260px|King Éomer at Aragorn's coronation]]

Éomer renewed the [[Oath of Eorl]] with Aragorn after the latter had been crowned King Elessar of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor (and legalizing [[Cirion]]'s grant of [[Calenardhon]] to the [[Éothéod]].) 

He became known as '''Éomer Éadig''', or "the Blessed", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.  Although Sauron was defeated, the West was never wholly free of enemies, and Elessar and Éomer rode together to war many times.

Éomer had met [[Lothíriel]], daughter of [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] during his stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son [[Elfwine]], who succeeded his father, after Éomer's death in the year [[FO 63]].

== Weapons ==

Éomer's [[sword]] was called [[Gúthwinë|''Gúthwinë'']] ([[Old English language|Old English]] for "battle-friend"). He also used a spear.

== Etymology ==

'''''Éomer''''' means "one who is famous in terms of horses" in Old English. The idea for his name was derived from the Anglo-Saxon words ''eoh'' ('war-horse') and ''maer'' ('famous') - his epithet ''éadig'' is a word meaning 'blessed'.

== Behind the scenes ==

The name ''Éomer'' appears as the name of a [[Wikipedia:Kings of the Angles|King of the Angles]], both in both the [[Wikipedia:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'']], in which he is the son of Angeltheow and grandson of [[Wikipedia:Offa of Angel|Offa]] and, in its West Saxon form Ēomǣr, in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]],'' in which he was the son of Offa and Modthryth and grandson of [[Wikipedia:Wermund|Wermund]].

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== Ralph Bakshi (1978) ===
[[File:Eomer1978.jpg|thumb|Eomer in Bakshi's 1978 Lord of the Rings]]
Eomer appears in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]. He has no spoken dialogue. Eomer first appears attacking Ugluk's orcs. Theoden later mentions him by name in a conversation with Gandalf. Eomer then appears at the end of the film, during the battle at Helm's Deep.

=== Lord of the Rings trilogy ===

In the [[The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy|''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] by [[Peter Jackson]], Éomer is exiled by Gríma Wormtongue before meeting Aragorn, and is an outcast until he arrives at Helm's Deep, summoned by Gandalf. In this sense, his character has been combined with the character of [[Erkenbrand]], who, in the book, is the one with whom Gandalf returns to [[Helm's Deep]]. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the [[The Return of the King (film)|third film]], Éomer kills the [[Mûmakil Mahûd|Chief of the mumakil riders]]. Éomer was played by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Karl Urban]].

=== The Lord of the Rings Online ===
[[File:LOTRO-Éomer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Éomer from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Éomer is first met in the town of Eaworth in the [[Entwash]] Vale where his riders make a brief stop shortly after meeting with the Three Hunters. Obligated to bring the player and their companions before the King, he takes them with his [[eored]] on their way to [[Edoras]]. After learning that Reeve Fastred of [[Snowbourn]] has ignored his order to bring his people into [[Westemnet]] across the [[Entwash]], he decides to bring the matter to the King directly. However, he is instead stripped of rank and imprisoned by [[Grima Wormtongue]] while the player and their companions are banished from [[Westemnet]]. After [[Theoden]] is released from Wormtongue's spell, Éomer rides towards the [[Fords of Isen]] at his side.

=== Lego: Lord of the Rings ===
Éomer also appears as a character in ''[[LEGO The Lord of the Rings]]''.[[File:EOMER.jpg|thumb|Eomer as a LEGO minifigure]]
