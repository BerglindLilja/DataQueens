'''Háma''' was a [[Rohirrim|Man of Rohan]], the doorward of [[Meduseld]] and captain of [[Théoden]]'s guard.

== Biography ==

Háma greeted [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] when they arrived to speak with King Théoden. He told the company to leave their weapons behind, by order of [[Gríma Wormtongue]], before entering the King's hall. He disarmed Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, but against the King's orders permitted Gandalf to keep his staff with him as a courtesy, though he knew, as he remarked, that "The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age."

Háma was present at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], and died defending the gates of the [[Hornburg]]. He was buried at Helm's Deep after the battle.<ref>''[[The Two Towers (novel)|The Lord of the Rings]]''[[The Two Towers (novel)|,'' The Two Towers'']]'','' Book Three, Chapter VI: "[[The King of the Golden Hall]]"</ref>

In the [[The Two Towers (film)|film]], Háma was still the doorward of Théoden. He allows Gandalf to pass with his staff as well. He is later killed by a [[Warg]]-rider scout during Saruman's attack on the retreating Rohirrim, and then devoured by the Warg while its rider fights [[Gamling]] and is killed by [[Legolas|Legolas.]] Háma's body is left behind. His only known relation is his son, [[Haleth (Son of Háma)|Haleth]] (a non-canon character), who is one of the many youth made to protect Helm's Deep.

[[New Zealand]] actor [[John Leigh]] plays Háma.
