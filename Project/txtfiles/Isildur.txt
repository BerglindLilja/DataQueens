'''Isildur''' was the oldest son of [[Elendil]] and brother to [[Anárion]]. He and Anárion jointly ruled [[Gondor]] in the South, while their father dwelt in the North.

In the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Isildur cut the [[One Ring]] from [[Sauron]]'s hand, but he refused to destroy it. Isildur was later killed by [[Orcs]] and the Ring was lost in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] for nearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Ring allowed Sauron's spirit to endure and ensured that he would remain a threat to [[Middle-earth]] for years to come. Isildur's bloodline survived in the [[Dúnedain|Dúnedain of the North]] and his [[Heir of Isildur|heirs]] would help end Sauron's power in the [[War of the Ring]].

== History ==
=== Life in Númenor ===

Isildur was born in [[Númenor]] in the year [[SA 3209]] of the [[Second Age]].<ref name="history">''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XII: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', VII: "The Heirs of Elendil"</ref> His younger brother Anárion was born in [[SA 3219]]. They lived at the haven of [[Rómenna]] on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was [[Amandil]], the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. The Lords of Andúnië were descended from the [[Kings of Númenor]] through [[Silmarien]], the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of Númenor, [[Tar-Elendil]].<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)</ref>

[[Elros]], the [[Half-elven]] and the first King of Númenor, had chosen the life of [[Men]], while his brother [[Elrond]] chose the life of [[Elves]]. Over time, the Kings of Númenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice and desired eternal life for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and from the [[Valar]] and they neglected the worship of [[Eru Ilúvatar|Eru]], the one who had created them.

A small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called [[the Faithful]]. Among these men were the Lords of Andúnië.

In [[SA 3262]], [[Ar-Pharazôn]], the King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt the Númenóreans in order to bring about their downfall. He used their desire for immortality and power to convince them to renounce Eru and worship [[Morgoth]].

Isildur learned that Sauron wanted Ar-Pharazôn to cut down [[Nimloth]], the White Tree that had come from the [[Undying Lands]]. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the [[King's Court]] and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.<ref name="downfall">''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)</ref>

As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the [[palantír]]i. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]], the [[Stone of Erech]], as well as his wife and his son [[Elendur]], who had been born in [[SA 3299]].<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XII: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', VII: "The Heirs of Elendil"</ref>

Isildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.

As Ar-Pharazôn felt the approach of old age, Sauron's lies finally convinced him he could achieve life in the Undying Lands. In [[SA 3319]],<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Second Age"</ref> Ar-Pharazôn set out with a [[Great Armament|great fleet]] intending to take the [[Undying Lands]] by force, but when he set foot on the shore, Eru Ilúvatar caused the Seas to open up and Valinor was hidden. The fleet sank and Númenor was destroyed by a great wave.<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)''</ref>

=== Life in Middle-earth ===

The nine ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of [[Middle-earth]]. Elendil landed in the north with four ships, while Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the [[Anduin]] in the south with three and two ships respectively. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of [[Arnor]] and the South-kingdom of [[Gondor]] in [[SA 3320]]. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he ruled from Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (i): "Númenor"</ref>

Isildur lived in [[Minas Ithil]] to the east of the Anduin, while Anárion made his home in [[Minas Anor]] to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of [[Osgiliath]], built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the [[Mountains of Shadow]] on the border of [[Mordor]], planting the [[White Tree of Gondor]] before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had already returned there in secret and had begun to rebuild his strength.

Isildur had one of the palantír called the [[Ithil-stone]], which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - [[Aratan]] born in [[SA 3339]] and [[Ciryon]] born in [[SA 3379]].

In the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the [[Erech|Hill of Erech]] at the entrance to the Blackroot Vale in the [[White Mountains]]. On the hilltop he placed the [[Stone of Erech]], a great black sphere that he had brought from Númenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Return of the King'', Book Five, Chapter II: "[[The Passing of the Gray Company]]"</ref>

Sauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in [[SA 3429]]. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with [[Gil-galad]], the last [[High King of the Ñoldor]] in Middle-earth who lived in [[Lindon]] west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] to oppose Sauron in [[SA 3430]]. That same year, Isildur's youngest son [[Valandil]] was born at the home of [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]].

=== The Last Alliance ===

The army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in [[SA 3431]]<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix B: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Third Age"</ref> and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their young son Valandil remained in Rivendell.

The War of the Last Alliance began in [[SA 3434]]. Sauron's forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to [[Barad-dûr]]. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother Anárion, who died in [[SA 3440]].<ref>''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref>

[[File:Isildur_and_One_Ring.png|thumb|270x270px|Isildur takes hold of the One Ring in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''|alt=]]

At last in [[SA 3441]], Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of [[Mount Doom]]. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword [[Narsil]] broke beneath him.

Isildur took up the hilt of the sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and [[Círdan]] were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with [[Gil-galad]] during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil.<ref name="rings">''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref> Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.

=== Rule and death ===

Isildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave Anárion's son [[Meneldil]] to rule in the South, after mentoring him in the duties of a king. On the summit of [[Halifirien]] in the [[Firien wood]], Isildur [[Tomb of Elendil|entombed]] the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil in memory of his brother and established the [[Tradition of Isildur]].

On [[September 5]], [[TA 2]], Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and a company of knights. They marched up the [[Vales of Anduin]] on the eastern side of the River, heading for the [[High Pass]] over the [[Misty Mountains]]. He intended to deliver the One Ring to Elrond, as suggested by his eldest son and confidante, Elendur.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Three, I: "The Disaster of the Gladden Fields"</ref>

Thirty days later, on [[October 4]], Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the [[Gladden Fields]]. The Orcs did not know that Isildur had the One Ring, but they were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack by forming a shield-wall, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book One, Chapter II: "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"</ref>

[[File:Isildur_tries_to_use_One_Ring.png|thumb|left|260px|Isildur putting on the Ring to escape]]

Before the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire [[Ohtar]], bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.

Isildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining [[Dúnedain]].

Isildur put on the Ring despite its pain and headed for the Anduin river. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring left Isildur's finger and was lost in the waters. Isildur initially felt an overwhelming sense of loss, but was then relieved as if a great burden had been lifted from him. He rose out of the water, but was spotted by orcs who shot him with arrows.<ref name=":0">''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Three, I: "The Disaster of the Gladden Fields"</ref>

The One Ring remained in the Gladden Fields until [[Déagol]] found it in [[TA 2463]].<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix B: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Third Age"</ref> Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin, but his weapons and armour were later recovered near the place of battle.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Three, I: "The Disaster of the Gladden Fields"</ref> As he had been wearing the [[Elendilmir]], this was lost with him.

Isildur's youngest son [[Valandil]] became the High King of Arnor when he came of age in the year 10,<ref name="thirdage">''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix B: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Third Age"</ref> but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of Anárion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the One Ring were found in a secret chamber in [[Orthanc]].<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Three, I: "The Disaster of the Gladden Fields"</ref> [[Saruman]] had likely found Isildur's remains and had them burnt.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== Films ===
Isildur appears in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']], both in the film's prologue and in later flashbacks. His role is largely unchanged from J.R.R. Tolkien's writings, though he is shown to have been brought to the Crack of Doom itself by Elrond, who unsuccessfully tries to convince him to destroy the Ring. He was portrayed by [[Harry Sinclair]].

=== Video games ===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Isildur.jpg|thumb|right|Isildur in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
In [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]], the player plays as Isildur in the first level, "Slopes of Mt. Doom". He is fully playable after completion of the level "The Tower of Orthanc".

In [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War|''Middle-earth: Shadow of War'']], Isildur is shown to have become a [[Nazgûl]] after his death at the Gladden Fields, when Sauron places one of the Nine rings on his finger, which resurrects him. When [[Talion]] and his dominated army of orcs and [[Olog-hai]] attacked Barad-dûr; [[Celebrimbor]] dominates Isildur, but Talion disapproves, and kills Isildur to set him free.

In [[LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game|''LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game'']], the player controls as Lego Isildur in the first level Slopes of Mt. Doom.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Isildur makes several extended appearances in flashbacks and session plays.
