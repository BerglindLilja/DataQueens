{{Quote|Proudfeet!|Odo Proudfoot correcting his cousin Bilbo}}

'''Odo Proudfoot''' was a [[Hobbit]] of the [[Shire]], and a cousin of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He characteristically had exceptionally large and hairy feet.

== Biography ==
[[File:Proudfoot.jpg|thumb|left|Odo Proudfoot at Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party]]
Odo Proudfoot was the cousin of Bilbo Baggins. Odo was born in [[TA 2904]] (SR 1304). His parents were Bodo Proudfoot and [[Linda (Baggins) Proudfoot]] – aunt of Bilbo. He had a son named [[Olo Proudfoot|Olo]] to an unnamed wife and a mischievous grandson [[Sancho Proudfoot]].

Odo Proudfoot was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party]] on [[September 22]], 1401 (3001). He became annoyed when Bilbo used the incorrect plural of his family name: [[Proudfoot]]s instead of the correct Proudfeet. When Bilbo disappeared using his [[One Ring|Magic Ring]], Odo took his feet off the table and stamped on the ground.

Odo Proudfoot died in [[TA 3005]] (SR 1405) of the [[Third Age]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter I: "[[A Long-expected Party (chapter)|A Long-expected Party]]"</ref><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix C]]: Family Trees, Baggins of Hobbiton</ref><ref>''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]''</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
In the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|first]] and [[The Return of the King (film)|third]] movies of [[Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy|Peter Jackson's film trilogy]], Odo was portrayed by [[Noel Appleby]], credited as "Everard Proudfoot". In the first film, he is chastised by his [[Mrs. Proudfoot|wife]] for enjoying [[Gandalf’s Fireworks|Gandalf's fireworks]] as Gandalf had been labeled as a disturber of the peace; Proudfoot's role during the party is the same.

In the third film, he appears briefly watching Frodo and his friends returning to the Shire and later in the [[Green Dragon Inn]].
