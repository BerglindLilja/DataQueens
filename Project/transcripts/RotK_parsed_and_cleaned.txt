Déagol: Sméagol! I’ve got one; I’ve got a fish, Sméag-Sméagol! 
Sméagol: Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in! 
 
Sméagol: Déagol? Déagol.  Give us that Déagol my love. 
Déagol: Why? 
Sméagol: Because…it’s my birthday and I wants it. 
 
Ring:  …batul. Ash nazg gimbatul… 
Sméagol: My Precious. 
 
Sméagol:  They cursed us. “Murderer” they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. 
Gollum: Gollum. Gollum. Gollum.  
Sméagol:  And we wept, precious. We wept to be so alone.

 
Sméagol: —and cool, So nice for feet, And we only wish, To catch a fish/ So juicy sweet.
 
Sméagol: And we forgot the taste of bread…the sound of trees…the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My Precious. 
 
Gollum: Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies. We must go, yes. We must go at once. 
Sam: Haven’t you had any sleep, Mister Frodo? 
 
Sam: I’ve gone and had too much. It must be getting late. 
Frodo: No. It isn’t. It isn’t midday yet. The days are growing darker. 

Gollum: Come on! Must go! No time! 
Sam: Not before Mister Frodo’s had somethin’ to eat. 
Gollum: No time to lose, silly. 
 
Sam: Here. 
Frodo: What about you? 
Sam: Oh, no. I’m not hungry. Leastways not for lembas bread. 
Frodo: Sam… 
Sam: All right. We don’t have that much left. We have to be careful or we’re going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mister Frodo. I’ve rationed it. There should be enough. 
Frodo: For what? 
Sam: The journey home. 
 
Gollum: Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry! 
 
Merry: It’s good. Definitely from the Shire. Longbottom Leaf.

Pippin: I feel like I’m back at the Green Dragon.
Merry: Green Dragon.
Pippin: A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day’s work.
Merry: Only, you’ve never done a hard day’s work. 
 
Merry: Welcome, my lord, to Isengard! 
Gimli: You young rascals! A merry hunt you’ve led us on, and now we find you, feasting and… smoking! 
Pippin: We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good. 
Gimli: Salted pork? 
Gandalf:  Hobbits. 
Merry: We’re under orders, from Treebeard, who’s taken over management of Isengard. 
 
Treebeard: Young Master Gandalf. I’m glad you’ve come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master. But there is a Wizard to manage here, locked in his tower.
Aragorn:  Show yourself.
Gandalf: Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.  
Gimli: Well, let’s just have his head and be done with it. 
Gandalf: No. We need him alive. We need him to talk.
Saruman:  and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace, you and I?
Théoden: We shall have peace. We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace.
Saruman: Gibbets and crows? Dotard! What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame? Let me guess. The key of Orthanc. Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
Gandalf: Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are at risk. But you can save them, Saruman. You were deep in the enemy’s counsel.
Saruman: So you have come here for information. I have some for you.

Saruman: Something festers in the heart of Middle-Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the Great Eye has seen it. Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. You’re all going to die.

Saruman: But you know this, don’t you, Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him, those he professes to love. Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.
Gimli: I’ve heard enough!  Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.
Gandalf: No. Come down, Saruman, and your life will be spared.
Saruman: Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it!

Gandalf: Saruman, your staff is broken.
 
Théoden: Grima, you need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a Man of Rohan. Come down. 
Saruman: A Man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helm’s Deep does not belong to you, Théoden Horse-master. You are a lesser son of greater sires.
Théoden: Grima, come down. Be free of him.
Saruman: Free? He will never be free.
Grima: No. 
Saruman: Get down, cur!

Gandalf: Saruman! You were deep in the enemy’s counsel. Tell us what you know!

Saruman: You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here. 

Gandalf: Send word to all our allies, and to every corner of Middle-Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike.
 
Treebeard: The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. Young trees. Wild trees. 
 
Aragorn: Pippin! 
Treebeard: Bless my bark! 
Gandalf: Peregrin Took! I’ll take that, my lad. Quickly now. 
 
Théoden: Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead! 
Crowd: Hail! 

Éomer: No pauses. No spills.

Gimli: And no regurgitation.
Legolas: So it’s a drinking game?

Gimli: Last one standing wins.
Men: What’ll we drink to? Let’s drink to victory! To victory!
 
 
Éowyn: Westu Aragorn hál. 
 
Théoden: I am happy for you. He is an honorable man. 
Éowyn: You are both honorable men. 
Théoden: It was not Théoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.  Ah, don’t listen to me. You are young, and tonight is for you. 

Gimli: Here, here. It’s the Dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women.  
Legolas: I feel something. A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it’s affecting me.
Gimli:  What did I say? He can’t hold his liquor. 

Legolas: Game over.
 
Merry and Pippin:
Oh you can search far and wide,
You can drink the whole town dry,
But you’ll never find a beer so brown,
As the one we drink in our hometown.
You can drink your fancy ales,
You can drink ‘em by the flagon,
But the only brew for the brave and true, 

Merry: Pippin!
Merry and Pippin: But the only brew for the brave and true, Comes from The Green Dragon!

Merry: Thank you! I win!
Pippin: Thank you!
 
Aragorn: No news of Frodo? 
Gandalf: No word. Nothing. 
Aragorn: We have time. Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor. 
Gandalf: Do we know that? 
Aragorn: What does your heart tell you? 
Gandalf: That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he’s alive. 
 
Sméagol: Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both! 
Gollum: Shh! Quiet. Mustn’t wake them. Mustn’t ruin it now. 
Sméagol: But they knows. They knows. They suspects us! 
Gollum: What’s it saying, my precious, my love? Is Sméagol losing his nerve? 
Sméagol: No. Not. Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Sméagol wants to see them…dead. 
Gollum: And we will. Sméagol did it once, he can do it again.  It’s ours. Ours! 
Sméagol: We must get the precious. We must get it back. 
Gollum: Patience. Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her. 
Sméagol: We lead them to the winding stairs. 
Gollum: Yes. The stairs. And then? 
Sméagol: Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go, until we come to…the tunnel. 
Gollum: And when they go in, there’s no coming out. She’s always hungry. She always needs…to feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. 
Sméagol: And they doesn’t taste very nice, does they, precious? 
Gollum: No. Not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats, Hobbit-meat.  And when she throws away the bones, and empty clothes, then we will find it. 
Sméagol: And take it for me! 
Gollum: For us. 
Sméagol: Y-yes, we meant “for us”. *gollum, gollum* 
Gollum: The precious will be ours, once the Hobbitses are dead. 
 
Sam: You treacherous little toad! 
 
Sméagol: No! No! Master! 
Frodo: No, Sam! Leave him alone! 
 
Sam: I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us! 
Sméagol: Never! Sméagol wouldn’t hurt a fly!  Argh! He’s a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Sméagol and who makes up nasty lies! 
Sam: You miserable little maggot! I’ll stove your head in! 
 
Frodo: Sam! 
Sam: Call me a liar? You’re a liar! 
Sméagol: Argh! 
Frodo: You scare him off, we’re lost! 
Sam: I don’t care! I can’t do it, Mister Frodo; I won’t wait around for him to kill us. 
Frodo: I’m not sending him away! 
 
Sam: You don’t see it, do you? He’s a villain! 
Frodo: We can’t do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. 
Sam: I’m on your side, Mr. Frodo. 
Frodo: I know, Sam, I know. Trust me. Come, Sméagol. 

Éowyn: What time is it? 
Aragorn: Not yet dawn.

Éowyn: I dreamed I saw a great wave, climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me, but I could not turn. I could
only stand there, waiting.
Aragorn: Night changes many thoughts. Sleep, Éowyn. Sleep…while you can.

Legolas: The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the east. A sleepless malice. 
 
Legolas: The Eye of the Enemy is moving. 
 
Merry: What you doing? 
 
Merry: Pippin! Pippin?
 
Merry: Pippin. What, are you mad? 
Pippin: I just want to look at it. Just one more time. 
Merry: Put it back! 
 
Merry: Pippin! No! Pippin… 
 
Legolas: He is here! 
 
Sauron: I see you… 
Merry: Pippin! Help! Gandalf, help! Someone help him! 
 
Merry: Pippin! 
Gandalf: Fool of a Took! 
 
Gandalf: Look at me. 
Pippin:  Gandalf, forgive me. 
Gandalf: Look at me. What did you see?  
Pippin: A tree. There was a white tree. In a courtyard of stone. It was dead. 
 
Pippin: The city was burning. 
Gandalf: Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? 
Pippin: I saw…I saw him! I can hear his voice in my head. 
Gandalf: And what did you tell him? Speak! 
Pippin: He asked me my name. I didn’t answer. He hurt me. 
Gandalf: What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? 
 
Gandalf: There was no lie in Pippin’s eyes. A fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We’ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the palantír a glimpse of the enemy’s plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm’s Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still,strength perhaps to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of Men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war. 
Théoden: Tell me; why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor? 
Aragorn: I will go. 
Gandalf: No!
Aragorn: They must be warned! 
Gandalf: They will be. 
 
Gandalf: Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry, hurry! 
Pippin: Where are we going? 
Merry:  Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? 
Pippin: I don’t know. I can’t help it. 
Merry: You never can. 
Pippin: I’m sorry, all right? I won’t do it again. 
Merry: Don’t you understand? The Enemy thinks you have the Ring. He’s going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here. 
Pippin: And you-you’re coming with me?  Merry? 
Merry: Come on. 
Pippin: How far is Minas Tirith? 
Gandalf: Three days’ ride, as the Nazgûl flies, and you better hope we don’t have one of those on our tail. 
Merry: Here, something for the road. 
 
Pippin: The last of the Longbottom Leaf. 
Merry: I know you’ve run out. You smoke too much, Pip. 
Pippin: But—But we’ll see each other soon…won’t we? 
Merry: I don’t know… I don’t know what’s going to happen. 
Pippin: Merry. 
Gandalf: Run Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste! 
Pippin: Merry! 
 
Aragorn: Merry! 

Merry: He’s always followed me, everywhere I went, since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble, but I was always there to get him out. Now he’s gone. Just like Frodo and Sam.
Aragorn: One thing I have learned about Hobbits: They’re a most hardy folk.
Merry: Foolhardy, maybe. He’s a Took. 
 
Elrond:  Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea…the last journey of Arwen Undómiel. 
 
Elrond:  There is nothing for you here, only death. 
 
Figwit: Lady Arwen, we cannot delay.  My Lady! 

Arwen: Tell me what you have seen. 
Elrond:  Arwen. 
Arwen: You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? 
Elrond: I looked into your future, and I saw death. 
Arwen: But there is also life. You saw there was a child! You saw my son! 
Elrond:  That future is almost gone. 
Arwen: But it is not lost. 
Elrond: Nothing is certain. 
Arwen:  Some things are certain. If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time. 
 
Arwen:  From the ashes a fire shall be woken. A light from the shadows shall spring. Renewed shall be blade that was broken. The crownless again shall be king. 
Arwen: Reforge the sword. Ada. 
 
Elrond:  Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. 
Arwen: This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence. 
 
Gandalf: We’ve just passed into the realm of Gondor. 
 
Gandalf: Minas Tirith. City of kings. 
 
Gandalf: Make way! 
 
Pippin: It’s the tree. Gandalf. Gandalf! 
Gandalf: Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The tree of the king. Lord Denethor, however, is not king. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. 
 
Gandalf: Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir’s father. To give him news of his beloved son’s death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, it’s better if you don’t speak at all, Peregrin Took. 
 
Gandalf: Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. 
Denethor: Perhaps you come to explain this.  Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. 
 
Pippin: Boromir died to save us, my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. 
Gandalf: Pippin! 
Pippin: I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt. 
Denethor: This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not, so mighty a man as he was?
Pippin: The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by many.

Gandalf: Get up!  My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor’s armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. 
Denethor:  You think you are wise, Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor. And with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan. Oh yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn. And I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. 
Gandalf: Authority is not given you to deny the return of the king, Steward. 
Denethor:  The rule of Gondor is mine, and no other’s! 
 
Gandalf:  Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. And the White Tree, the tree of the king, will never bloom again.
Pippin: Why are they still guarding it?
Gandalf: They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was, before it fell into decay. The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living, and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons.  Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of kings failed. The White Tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. 

Pippin: Mordor.
Gandalf; Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. 
Pippin: A storm is coming.
Gandalf: This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron’s making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin. 
Pippin: Well, Minas Tirith, very impressive. So where are we off to next?
Gandalf: Oh, it’s too late for that, Peregrin. There’s no leaving this city. Help must come to us.

Sam: It must be getting near teatime. Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
Gollum:  We’re not in decent places.

Sam: Mr. Frodo? What is it?
Frodo: It’s just a feeling. I don’t think I’ll be coming back.
Sam: Yes, you will. Of course you will. That’s just morbid thinking. We’re going there and back again just like Mr. Bilbo. You’ll see.

Frodo:I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor. Long ago, when there was a king. 

Sam: Mr. Frodo, look. The king has got a crown again. 
Gollum: Come on, Hobbits! Mustn’t stop now. This way.
 
Pippin:  So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don’t actually expect me to do any fighting, do they? 
Gandalf: 

Gandalf: Ridiculous Hobbit. Guard of the Citadel.  Thank you.
Pippin:  There’s no more stars. Is it time?
Gandalf: Yes.   

Pippin: It’s so quiet. 
Gandalf: It’s the deep breath before the plunge. 
Pippin: I don’t want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can’t escape is even worse.  Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam? 
Gandalf: There never was much hope. Just a fool’s hope. Our Enemy is ready. His full strength gathered.  Not only Orcs, but Men as well. Legions of Haradrim from the south. Mercenaries from the coast. All will answer Mordor’s call. This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer-stroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defense of this city will be gone. 
Pippin: But we have the White Wizard. That’s got to count for something. Gandalf? 
Gandalf:  He is the lord of the Nazgûl, the greatest of the Nine. Minas Morgul is his lair. 
 
Gollum: The Dead City. Very nasty place. Full of enemies. 
 
Gollum: Quick. Quick! They will see. They will see! 
 
Gollum: Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it. The way into Mordor. The secret stair. 
 
Gollum: Climb! 
 
Sam: No! Mister Frodo! 
Gollum: Not that way! 
 
Gollum: What’s it doing? 
Sam: No! 
Frodo: They’re calling me… 
Gollum: No!
 
Sméagol: Hide! Hide! 
 
Frodo:  I can feel his blade! 
 
Gandalf: We come to it at last. The great battle of our time. 
 
Gollum: Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb. 
 
Gandalf: The board is set. The pieces are moving. 
Gollum: Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it’s into the tunnel.
Sam: Hey, what’s in this tunnel? 
Frodo: What was that about?
Sam: Nothing. Just clearing something up.
 
Gandalf: Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me. 

Madril: It’s been very quiet across the river. The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We’ve sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the north, we’ll have some warning.
 
Gothmog: Quiet!

Gondorian Soldier: We need 10 more.

Gothmog: Kill him!

Faramir: They’re not coming from the north. To the river! Quick. Quick! Go. Come on!  
 
Gothmog:  Faster. 
 
Gothmog: Draw swords! 
 
Gandalf:  Amon Dîn. 
Guard: The beacon! The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit! 
 
Gandalf: Hope is kindled. 
 
Aragorn: The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid! 
 
Théoden:  And Rohan will answer! 
 
Théoden: Muster the Rohirrim!  Assemble the Men at Dunharrow. As many Men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor and war. Gamling! 
Gamling: My lord. 
Théoden: Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow. 
Gamling: I will. 
 
Aragorn: Will you ride with us? 
Éowyn: Just to the encampment. It’s tradition for the Women of the Court to farewell the men. 
 
Éowyn: The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle, even to death. You have given us hope. 

Merry: Excuse me. I have a sword. Please accept it. I offer you my service, Théoden King.
Théoden:  And gladly I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

Gimli: Horse-master. I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
Legolas: Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands. 
 
Théoden:  So, it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of our time will be decided. 
Éomer: Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken. Now fulfill them all! To lord and land!  
 
Madril: Faramir! 
 
Madril: We cannot hold them! The city is lost! 
 
Faramir: Tell the Men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith. 
 
Soldier: Nazgûl! 
Soldier: Take cover! Nazgûl! 
Faramir: Fall back! Fall back to Minas Tirith! 
 
Faramir: Retreat! Retreat! 
Soldier: Run for your lives!
 
Gothmog: The age of Men is over. The time of the Orc has come.
 
Soldier: It’s Mithrandir! The White Rider! 
 
Faramir: Mithrandir! They broke through our defenses. They’ve taken the bridge and the west bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. 
Gondorian Soldier: It is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom! 
Gandalf: Foreseen and done nothing! 
 
Gandalf: Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
Faramir: No.
 
Pippin: You’ve seen Frodo and Sam? 
 
Gandalf: Where? When? 
Faramir: In Ithilien. Not two days ago. 
 
Faramir: Gandalf, they’ve taken the road to the Morgul Vale. 
 
Gandalf: And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol. 
 
Pippin: What does that mean? What’s wrong? 
Gandalf: Faramir, tell me everything. Tell me all you know.

Denethor: This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter ruin? 
Faramir: I did what I judged to be right.
Denethor: What you judged to be right. You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling. It should have been brought back to the Citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults not to be used. Unless at the uttermost end of need. 
Faramir: I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her.
Denethor: Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a king of old. Boromir would have remembered his father’s need. He would have brought me a kingly gift. 
Faramir: Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. He would’ve fallen.
Denethor: You know nothing of this matter!
Faramir: He would have kept it for his own. And when he returned you would not have known your son.
Denethor: Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard’s pupil! 
Faramir: Father?
Denethor:  My son.

Denethor:  Leave me. 
 
Gollum: Careful, master! Careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the stairs. Come master! 
 
Gollum: Come to Sméagol… 
 
Sam: Mr. Frodo!  Get back you! Don’t touch him! 
 
Gollum: Why does he hates poor Sméagol? What has Sméagol ever done to him? 
 
Gollum: Master? Master carries heavy burden. Sméagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden. The fat one cannot know. Sméagol look after master. He wants it. He needs it. Sméagol sees it in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you. 
 
Witch-king: Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all. 
Gothmog: What of the Wizard? 
Witch-king: I will break him. 
 
Soldier: What of Théoden’s Riders? Will Rohan’s army come? Mithrandir.
Gandalf: Courage is the best defense you have now.

Pippin: What were you thinking, Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of Men?
Faramir: It was well-done. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. You are to join the tower guard.
Pippin: I didn’t think they would find any livery that would fit me.
Faramir: Once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.
Pippin: This was yours?
Faramir: Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me.
Pippin: Well, I’m taller than you were then. Though I’m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

Faramir: Never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike, he and my father. Proud. Stubborn even. But strong.
Pippin: I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it.
 
Pippin: Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from…from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me. 
Denethor:  Disloyalty with vengeance. 
 
Denethor:  I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses, defenses that your brother long held intact. 
Faramir: What would you have me do? 
Denethor: I will not yield the river and Pelennor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken. 
Faramir: My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun. 
Denethor: Much must be risked in war. Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord’s will? 
 
Faramir:  You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived. 
 
Denethor:  Yes, I wish that. 
 
Faramir: Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead. 
 
Faramir: If I should return, think better of me, Father. 
Denethor:  That will depend on the manner of your return. 
 
Sam: What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we? 
Gollum: S-sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Sméagol shows them secret ways that nobody else can find, and they say “sneak”! Sneak? Very nice friend, oh, yes, my precious. Very nice, very nice. 
Sam: All right. All right! You just startled me is all. What were you doing? 
Gollum:  Sneaking. 
Sam: Fine. Have it your own way.  I’m sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo. We have to be moving on. 
Frodo: It’s dark still. 
Sam: It’s always dark here. 
 
Sam: It’s gone! The Elven-bread! 
Frodo: What? That’s all we have left! 
 
Sam:  He took it! He must have! 
Gollum: Sméagol? No, no, not poor Sméagol. Sméagol hates nasty Elf-bread! 
Sam: You’re a lying rat! What did you do with it!? 
Frodo:  He doesn’t eat it. He can’t have taken it. 
 
Gollum: Look! What’s this? Crumbs on his jacketses!  He took it! He took it! I’ve seen him. He’s always stuffing his face when master’s not looking! 
Sam: That’s a filthy lie! 
 
Sam: You stinking, two-faced sneak! 
Frodo: Sam! Stop it! Sam!  
Sam: I’ll kill him! 
Frodo: Sam! No! 
 
Sam: Oh, my– I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it to go so far. I was just so– so angry. Here, just— Let’s just rest a bit. 
Frodo: I’m all right. 
Sam: No. No, you’re not all right. You’re exhausted. It’s that Gollum. It’s this place. It’s that thing around your neck!  Share the load. 
Frodo: Get away!  
Sam: I don’t want to keep it! I just want to help. 
Gollum: See? See? He wants it for himself. 
Sam:  Shut up, you! Go away! Get out of here! 
Frodo: No, Sam. It’s you. I’m sorry, Sam. 
Sam: But he’s a liar. He’s poisoned you against me. 
Frodo: You can’t help me anymore. 
Sam:  You don’t mean that. 
Frodo:  Go home. 
 
Gandalf: Faramir! Faramir!  
Gandalf: Your father’s will has turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so rashly! 
Faramir: Where does my allegiance lie if not here? This is the city of the Men of Numenor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory, her wisdom.
 
Gandalf: Your father loves you, Faramir. He will remember it before the end. 
 
Denethor: Can you sing, Master Hobbit? 
Pippin: Well, yes. At least, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls and evil times. 
Denethor:  And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song. 
 
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.
Through shadow, to the edge of night,
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade,
All shall fade! All shall fade… 

Soldiers: Make way for the king. Make way! The king is here. My lord. Hail to you, sire. 
Théoden: Grimbold, how many? 
Grimbold: I bring five hundred Men from the Westfold, my lord. 
Soldier: We have three hundred more from Fenmarch, Théoden King. 
Théoden: Where are the riders from Snowbourn? 
Soldier: None have come, my lord. 
 
Théoden: Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I’d hoped for. 
Aragorn: Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. 
Théoden: More will come. 
Aragorn: Every hour lost hastens Gondor’s defeat. We have till dawn, then we must ride. 
 
Legolas: The horses are restless and the men are quiet. 
Éomer: They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. 
Gimli: That road there, where does that lead? 
Legolas: It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain. 
Éomer: None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil.
 
Gimli: Aragorn! 
 
Gimli: Let’s find some food. 
 
Éowyn: There. A true esquire of Rohan. 
Merry: I’m ready! 
 
Merry: Sorry. It isn’t all that dangerous. It’s not even sharp. 
Éowyn:  Well, that’s no good. You won’t kill many Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on. 
 
Éowyn:  To the smithy. Go! 
Éomer: You should not encourage him. 
Éowyn: You should not doubt him. 
Éomer: I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. 
 
Éowyn:  Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?
Éomer: You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him and the blood and the screams and the horrow of battle take hold, do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so. War is the province of Men, Éowyn.  
 
Arwen: I choose a mortal life. 
 
Arwen: I wish I could’ve seen him…one last time. 
 
Guard: Sir? King Théoden awaits you, My Lord. 
 
Théoden: I take my leave.  
 
Aragorn:  My lord Elrond. 
Elrond: I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron’s power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen’s life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come. 
Aragorn: It will not be our end, but his. 
Elrond: You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron’s armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know. But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south. They’ll be in the city in two days. You’re outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more Men. 
Aragorn: There are none. 
Elrond: There are those who dwell in the mountain. 
 
Aragorn: Murderers… traitors! You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing! They answer to no one! 
Elrond: They will answer to the King of Gondor! 
 
Elrond: Andúril, Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil. 
Aragorn: Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.  The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith. 
Elrond: The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt road. 
Elrond: Ónen i-Estel Edain.  
Aragorn: Ú-chebin estel anim.  
 
Éowyn: Why are you doing this? The war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men. 
Aragorn: Éowyn… 
Éowyn: We need you here. 
Aragorn:  Why have you come? 
Éowyn: Do you not know? 
Aragorn: It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek. 

Aragorn: I have wished you joy since first I saw you. 
 
Gimli: Just where do you think you’re off to? 
Aragorn: Not this time. This time you must stay, Gimli. 
 
Legolas: Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves? 
Gimli: You might as well accept it. We’re going with you, laddie. 
 
Soldier: What’s happening? Where is he going? I don’t understand. Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle? 
Gamling: He leaves because there is no hope. 
Théoden: He leaves because he must. 
Gamling: Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor. 
Théoden: No, we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. 
 
Théoden: I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill. 
Éowyn:  What other duty would you have me do, my lord? 
Théoden:  You shall live to see these days renewed. No more despair. 
 
Gimli: What kind of an army would linger in such a place? 
Legolas: One that is cursed. Long ago, the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Gondor, to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor’s need was dire, they fled, vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the great twilight? The forgotten people. The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the north shall he come. Need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead. 
 
Gimli: The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. 
Legolas: The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead. And the Dead keep it. The way is shut. 
 
Aragorn: Brego! 
 
Aragorn: I do not fear death! 
 
Gimli: Well, this is a thing unheard-of. An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not! Oh! Oh, I’d never hear the end of it! 
 
Théoden: We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead. And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. 
 
Théoden: Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc. 
Merry: All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind. 
Théoden: It’s a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith, and none of my Riders can bear you as a burden. 
Merry: I want to fight! 
Théoden: I will say no more. 
 
Éowyn: Ride with me. 
 
Merry: My Lady! 
Éomer: Form up! Move out! Form up! Move out!
Théoden: Ride! Ride now to Gondor! 

Gimli: What is it? What do you see?
Legolas: I see shapes of men. And of horses.
Gimli: Where?
Legolas; Pale banners like shreds of cloud. Spears rise like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist. The Dead are following. They have been summoned.
Gimli: The Dead? Summoned? I knew that. Very good. Very good! Legolas! 

Aragorn: Do not look down.
 
King of the Dead: Who enters my domain? 
Aragorn: One who will have your allegiance. 
King of the Dead: The Dead do not suffer the living to pass. 
Aragorn: You will suffer me. 
 
King of the Dead: The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead. And the Dead keep it. The way is shut. Now you must die. 
 
Aragorn: I summon you to fulfill your oath. 
King of the Dead: None but the King of Gondor may command me. 
 
King of the Dead: That line was broken. 
Aragorn: It has been remade.  What say you? 
 
Aragorn: What say you? 
Gimli: You waste your time, Aragorn! They had no honor in life, they have none now in death. 
Aragorn: I am Isildur’s heir. Fight for me, and I will hold your oaths fulfilled! 
 
Aragorn:  What say you?!
Gimli: Stand, you traitors!

Aragorn: Out!

Aragorn: Legolas! Run!

King of the Dead: We fight. 
 
Soldier: Open the gate! Quick! 
 
Soldier: Quick, hurry! 
 
Denethor: Faramir! 
 
Denethor: Say not that he has fallen! 
Soldier: They were outnumbered. None survived. 
 
Gothmog: Fear. The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners! 
Orc: Catapults! 
 
Denethor: My sons are spent. 
 
Denethor: My line has ended. 
 
Pippin: He’s alive! 
Denethor: The House of Stewards has failed! 
Pippin: He needs medicine, my lord! 
 
Denethor: My line has ended! 
Pippin:  My lord! 
 
Denethor: Rohan has deserted us.  Abandon your posts! Flee! Flee for your lives! 
 
Gandalf: Prepare for battle! 
 
Gandalf: Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!
 
Gandalf: Return to your posts! 
 
Gandalf: Send these foul beasts into the abyss. 
 
Gothmog: Stay where you are. 
Soldier 
Soldier: Down to the lower level. Quick! 
 
Gandalf: Hold them back! Do not give into fear! Stay at your posts! Fight! 
 
Gandalf:  Not at the towers! Aim for the Trolls! Kill the Trolls! Bring them down! 

Gandalf: Fight them back!
 
Gandalf: Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel! 
Pippin:  They’d called us out to fight. 
 
Gandalf: This is no place for a Hobbit! 
 
Gandalf:  Guard of the Citadel indeed. Now, back! Up the hill! Quickly! Quick!

Gothmog: What are you doing, you useless scum?!
Orc: The door won’t give. It’s too strong.
Gothmog: Get back there and smash it down.
Orc: But nothing can breach it.
Gothmog: Grond will breach it. Bring up the wolf’s head. 
 
Armies of Sauron:  Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! 

Aragorn: You may go no further. You will not enter Gondor.

Captain: Who are you to deny us passage?
Aragorn: Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun’s ear.
Gimli: Mind your aim. 

Gimli: That’s it. Right. We warned you. Prepare to be boarded.
Captain: Boarded? By you and whose army?
Aragorn: This army.
 
 
Gollum: In there.  
Frodo:  What is this place? 
Gollum: Master must go inside the tunnel. 
Frodo: Now that I’m here, I don’t think I want to. 
Gollum: It’s the only way. Go in, or go back. 
Frodo:  What’s that smell? 
Gollum: Orcses’ filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.  Hurry! This way! 
Frodo: Sméagol?  
Gollum: Over here. 
 
Frodo: It’s sticky! What is it? 
Gollum:  You’ll see! Oh, yes. You will see. 
Frodo: Sméagol? Sméagol! Sméagol!  
 
Galadriel:  And you, Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star. 
 
Galadriel:  May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. 
Frodo: Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!  
 
Gollum: Naughty little fly, why does he cry? Caught in a web, soon you’ll be…eaten. 
 
Gollum: Got away, did it, Precious? Not this time! Not this time! 
Frodo: No!
 
Sméagol: It wasn’t us! It wasn’t us! Sméagol wouldn’t hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the Precious! The precious made us do it! 
 
Frodo: I have to destroy it, Sméagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes. 
 
Frodo: I’m so sorry, Sam. I’m so sorry. 
 
Galadriel: This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way, no one will. 

Éomer: The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level’s in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.
Théoden: Time is against us. Make ready!
Éowyn: Take heart, Merry. It will soon be over.
Merry: My lady, you are fair and brave and have much to live for, and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds. But I’m not. I’m a Hobbit. And I know I can’t save Middle-Earth. I just want to help my friends. Frodo. Sam. Pippin. More than anything, I wish I could see them again.
Éomer: Prepare to move out!
Théoden: Make haste. We ride through the night.

Éowyn; To battle.
Merry: To battle.
 
Gandalf: Back to the gate! Hurry! 

Denethor: I am steward of the House of Anárion. Thus have I walked. And thus now will I sleep. Gondor is lost. There is no hope for Men. 

Denethor: Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must. 
 
Denethor: No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long, slow, sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.  Bring wood and oil! 
 
Gandalf: Steady. Steady! 
 
Gandalf: You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. 
 
Gandalf: Volley! Fire! 
 
Sam: Let him go, you filth! 
 
Sam: Let him go! 
 
Sam: You will not touch him again! 
 
Sam: Come on and finish it! 
 
Sam: Back! 
 
Sam: Mr. Frodo! 
 
Sam: Oh, no. Frodo! 
 
Sam: Mr. Frodo! 
 
Sam: Wake up! Don’t leave me here alone. Don’t go where I can’t follow. Wake up! 
 
Sam: Not asleep…dead! 
 
Shagrat: You get back, you scum! What’s this? Looks like old Shelob’s been having a bit of fun. 
Gorbag: Killed another one, has she? 
Shagrat: No. This fellow ain’t dead. 
Sam:  Not dead? 
Shagrat: She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her way with them. That’s how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the tower! 
 
Sam: Samwise, you fool! 
Gorbag: This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. 
Shagrat: Then he’ll wish he’d never been born. 
 
Denethor: The house of his spirit crumbles. He is burning. Already burning. 
 
Pippin:  He’s not dead! He’s not dead! 
 
Pippin: No! No! No! No! He’s not dead! No!
Denethor: Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin. I release you from my service. Go now and die in what way seems best to you. 
 
Denethor: Pour oil on the wood! 

Soldier: Come on, soldier! Move it! Hurry along there! Hurry along! 
Pippin: Gandalf! Where is Gandalf? Gandalf! 
 
Gandalf: Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back to the second level! Get the women and children out. Get them out! Retreat!
Soldier: Come on. Come on!
Gothmog: Move into the city. Kill all in your path. 

Soldier: Take them down! 
Gandalf: Fight! Fight to the last man! Fight for your lives! 
Pippin: Gandalf!  Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind! He’s burning Faramir alive!
Gandalf: Up! Quickly! 

Gandalf: Go back to the abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master!
Witch-King: Do you not know death when you see it, old man? This is my hour. 
Pippin: Gandalf! 
Witch-King: You have failed. The world of Men will fall.
 
Éowyn: Courage, Merry. Courage for our friends.  
Gothmog: Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks! Pikes in front. Archers behind. 
 
Théoden: Éomer, take your éored down the left flank.
Éomer: Flank ready. 
Théoden:Gamling, follow the King’s banner down the center. Grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness! 
 
Théoden: Arise, Arise, Riders of Théoden! 
 
Théoden: Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
 
Éowyn:  Whatever happens, stay with me. I’ll look after you. 
 
Théoden: Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin, and the world’s ending! Death! 
Rohirrim: Death! 
 
Théoden: Death! 
Rohirrim: Death! 
Théoden: Death! 
Merry and Éowyn: Death! 
Théoden: Forth Eorlingas!! 
 
Gothmog: Fire! 
 
Merry: Death! 
 
Théoden: Charge! 
Gothmog: Fire at will! 
 
  
Denethor: Set a fire in our flesh. 
 
Gandalf: Stay this madness! 

Denethor: You may triumph in the field of battle for a day, but against the power that has risen in the east, there is no victory. 
 
Denethor: No! You will not take my son from me!
Pippin: No! No! 
 
Denethor: Faramir. 
 
Gandalf: So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion. 
 
Éomer: Drive them to the river! 
Théoden: Make safe the city! 
 
Théoden: Re-form the line! Re-form the line! 
 
Théoden: Sound the charge! Take them head-on! 
 
Théoden: Charge! 
 
Éowyn: Take the reins! Pull him left! Left! 
 
Éomer:  Aim for their heads! 
 
Théoden: Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down! 
 
Éowyn: Merry!
 
 
Pippin: I didn’t think it would end this way. 
 
Gandalf: End? No, the journey doesn’t end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it. 
 
Pippin: What, Gandalf? See what? 
Gandalf: White shores, and beyond. A far green country under a swift sunrise. 
Pippin: Well, that isn’t so bad. 
Gandalf: No. No, it isn’t. 
 
Théoden: Rally to me! To me! 
 
Witch-king: Feast on his flesh. 
Éowyn:  I will kill you if you touch him! 
Witch-king: Do not come between a Nazgûl and his prey. 
 
Head Orc: Late as usual, pirate scum! There’s knife-work here that needs doing. Come on, ya sea rats! Get off your ships! 
 
Gimli:  There’s plenty for the both of us. May the best Dwarf win! 
 
Witch-king:  You fool. No man can kill me! Die now. 
 
Éowyn: I am no man! 
 
Legolas:  15, 16… 
Gimli:  17… 
 
Gimli: …29… 
Éowyn;  Merry!

Aragorn: Legolas! 
 
Legolas:  33, 34… 
 
Gimli: That still only counts as one! Come on, then! Come on!
 
Théoden:  I know your face…Éowyn. 
 
Théoden: My eyes darken. 
Éowyn:  No. No. I am going to save you. 
Théoden:  Éowyn… 
 
King of the Dead: Release us. 
Gimli: Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they’re dead. 
King of the Dead: You gave us your word. 
Aragorn: I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace. 

Pippin: Merry.
Eomer: 


Pippin: Merry! Merry!  
Pippin:  It’s Pippin. 
Merry:  I knew you’d find me. 
Pippin: Yes. 
Merry: Are you going to leave me? 
Pippin: No, Merry. I’m going to look after you. 
 
Shagrat: Hands off! That shiny shirt, that’s mine! 
Gorbag: It’s going to the Great Eye, along with everything else. 
 
Shagrat: I don’t take orders from stinking Morgul-rats! 
 
Gorbag: You touch it, and I’ll stick this blade in your gut. 
 
Shagrat: The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! 
 
Sam:  And that’s for my old Gaffer! 
 
Gorbag: Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.  I’m going to bleed you like a stuck pig! 
 
Sam: Not if I stick you first. 
Frodo: Sam! 
 
Frodo: Oh, Sam, I’m so sorry. Sorry for everything. 
Sam: Let’s get you out of here.  
Frodo:  It’s too late. It’s over. They’ve taken it. Sam, they took the Ring. 
Sam: Beggin’, your pardon, but they haven’t.  
Frodo: Give it to me.  Sam. Give me the Ring. 
 
Frodo: You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you, Sam.  
Sam: Come on, Mr. Frodo. We’d best find you some clothes. You can’t go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.  
 
Sam: We did it, Mr. Frodo. We made it to Mordor. 
Frodo:  It’s him, the Eye! 
Sam: We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo. There’s nothing for it.  Come on. let’s just make it down the hill for starters. 
 
Gandalf: Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. 
Aragorn: If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it. 
Gandalf: It’s only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. 
Gimli:  Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care? 
Gandalf: Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.  I’ve sent him to his death. 
Aragorn:  No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that. 
Gimli: How? 
Aragorn: Draw out Sauron’s armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. 
 
Éomer: We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. 
Aragorn: Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron’s Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. 
Legolas: A diversion. 
Gimli: Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for? 
Gandalf:  Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. 
Aragorn: Oh, I think he will.

Aragorn:  Behold the Sword of Elendil.
 
 

Éowyn: The city has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun. It grows so cold.
Faramir: It’s just the damp of the first spring rain. I do not believe this darkness will endure.
 
 
Sam: Look, the Orcs, they’re moving off. You see, Mr. Frodo, some luck at last. 

Orc: Come on! Faster!

Orc: Come along, you scum! I’ll whip you down to the bone, you! Come on! What have I told you?!

Orc: Get up! Come on, you slugs!  You two are going straight to the front line! Now, move it! Go on! Fall in! Move it!

Orc:  To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it! Don’t you know we’re at war?

Orc: Company, halt! Inspection!
Frodo: 
Sam:  Mr. Frodo! Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!
Frodo: It’s so heavy.

Sam: On, no. What do I do? What do we do?
Frodo: Hit me.
Sam: What?
Frodo: Hit me, Sam! Start fighting!
Sam: Get off of me! Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot! Get off of me!
Orc: Break it up! Break it up!
Inspecting Orc: Oi! I’ll have your guts if you don’t shut this rabble down!
Frodo: Go, Sam! Now! 

Inspecting Orc:  Move along, scum!
Orc: Back in the line! You maggots! Get back into the line, you slugs! Dig it, you slugs. Move it!

Frodo:  I can’t—I can’t—I can’t manage the Ring, Sam. It’s—It’s—It’s such a weight to carry. It such a weight.
Sam:  We’re going that way. Straight as we can. There’s no point carrying anything we’re not sure to need.

Sam:  Mr. Frodo. Look. There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch.
 
 
Sam: Take mine. There’s a few drops left. 
 
Frodo: There will be none left for the return journey. 
Sam: I don’t think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo. 
 
Sam: Frodo! Get down! Hide! 
 
Sam: Frodo! 
 
Pippin: Where are they? 
 
Aragorn: Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him! 
 

Mouth of Sauron: My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. 

Mouth of Sauron: Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
Gandalf: We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this: The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return.
Mouth of Sauron:  Old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee. 

Pippin: Frodo.

Pippin: Frodo!
Gandalf: Silence.
Merry: No!
Gandalf: Silence!
Mouth of Sauron: The Halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would’ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf. He did.

Mouth of Sauron: And who is this? Isildur’s heir? It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.

Gimli: I guess that concludes negotiations.
Aragorn: I do not believe it. I will not.
 
Aragorn: Pull back! Pull back!  
Sam: It’s gone, Mr. Frodo. The light’s passed on, away towards the north. Something’s drawn its gaze.  
 
Aragorn: Hold your ground! Hold your ground. 
 
Aragorn: Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down. But it is not this day. This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West! 
 
Gimli: Never thought I’d die fighting side by side with an Elf. 
Legolas: What about side by side with a friend? 
Gimli: Aye. I could do that. 
 
Sam: Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It’ll be spring soon. And the Orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And they’ll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,  and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? 
Frodo:  
Sam:  Then let us be rid of it, once and for all! Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on! 
 
Sauron’s voice: Aragorn. Elessar. 
 
Aragorn: For Frodo.
 
 
Sam: Look, Mr. Frodo. A doorway! We’re almost there. 
 
Gollum: Clever Hobbits to climb so high! 

Gollum: Mustn’t go that way. Mustn’t hurt the precious. 
Frodo: You swore! You swore on the precious! Sméagol promised! 
Gollum: Sméagol lied.
 
Sam:  Frodo! 
 
Pippin:  
 
Sam: Frodo! 
 
Frodo: I’m here, Sam. 
Sam: Destroy it! 
 
Sam: Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! 
 
Sam: What are you waiting for? Just let it go! 
 
Frodo: The Ring is mine. 
 
Sam: No…no… 
 
Sam: Nooooooo! 
 
 
Gollum: Yes! Yes! Precious! Precious! Precious! Precious! 
 
Sam: Give me your hand! 
 
Sam: Take my hand! 
 
Sam: No! 
 
Sam: Don’t you let go! Don’t let go. Reach! 
 
Merry:  Frodo! Frodo! 
 
Frodo: It’s gone. It’s done. 
Sam: Yes, Mr. Frodo. It’s over now. 
 
Frodo: I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf’s fireworks. The lights in the Party Tree. 
Sam:  
Frodo: I’m glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things. 
 
 
 
Frodo:  Gandalf? 
 
Merry: Frodo! 
 
Frodo:  Gimli! 
 
Frodo:  Aragorn. 
 
 
Gandalf: Now come the days of the king.  May they be blessed. 
 
Aragorn:  This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world, that we may share in the days of peace. 
 
 
Aragorn: Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn’ Ambar-metta. 
 
 
Aragorn: Hannon le.  
 
 
Aragorn:  My friends. You bow to no one. 
 
Frodo:  Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey, we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. 
 
Frodo: We were home. 
 
 
Frodo:  There are some things that time cannot mend, some hurts that go too deep…that have taken hold. 
 
Sam: Mr. Frodo? What is it? 
Frodo:  It’s been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It’s never really healed. 
 
Sam: ‘There and Back again, a Hobbit’s Tale by Bilbo Baggins’ And ‘The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins.’ You finished it. 
 
Frodo: Not quite. There’s room for a little more.  
 
Frodo:  Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end, that each of must come and go in the telling. Bilbo’s story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him…save one. 
Bilbo: Tell me again, lad, where are we going? 
Frodo: To the harbor, Bilbo. The Elves have accorded you a special honor, a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth. 
 
Bilbo: Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? Hmm? The one I gave you. 
Frodo:  I’m sorry, Uncle. I’m afraid I lost it. 
Bilbo: Oh. Pity? I should like to have held it one last time. 
 
 
Bilbo:  Oh! Well, here’s a sight that I have never seen before. 
 
Galadriel: The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men. 
Elrond: I Aear can vên na mar.  
Bilbo:  I think I’m quite ready for another adventure. 
 
Gandalf: Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. 
 
Gandalf: I will not say, “Do not weep”, for not all tears are an evil.  It is time, Frodo. 
 
Sam: What does he mean? 
Frodo: We set out to save the Shire, Sam. And it has been saved. But not for me. 
Sam:  You don’t mean that. You can’t leave. 
Frodo:  The last pages are for you, Sam. 
 
 
Frodo:  My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. 
 
Frodo:  You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in this story will go on. 
Sam: Well, I’m back.
