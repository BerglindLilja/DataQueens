'''Gwaihir''', also known as '''Gwaihir the Windlord''', was lord of the [[Great Eagles]] during the [[Third Age]].

== Biography ==

Gwaihir was descended from [[Thorondor]], the greatest Eagle who ever lived. It was said that he and his brother [[Landroval]] aided Thorondor in rescuing [[Beren]] and [[Luthien]] from [[Angband]].<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XI: ''[[The War of the Jewels (book)|The War of the Jewels]],'' Part One. [[The Grey Annals]]</ref>

At some point in his life, [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] saved him from a poisoned [[arrow]].

=== War of the Ring ===

In the summer of [[TA 3018]], Gandalf asked [[Radagast]] the Brown to send word among his friends the birds to learn what they could of [[Sauron|the Enemy]]'s plans. The Great Eagles flew far and wide and gathered news of the [[Nazgûl]], the muster of Orcs and Wargs, and the escape of [[Gollum]] from [[Mirkwood]].

Gwaihir went to [[Isengard]] to bring this news to [[Gandalf]]. In the early hours of September 18, he found Gandalf imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. Gwaihir bore Gandalf away, and when the Wizard said that he needed a horse, Gwaihir set him down in the land of [[Rohan]].

On [[February 17]], [[3019]], Gwaihir was searching for Gandalf at the request of [[Galadriel]] when he found the Wizard atop the [[Silvertine]]. Gandalf had vanquished the [[Balrog]] in the [[Battle of the Peak]], but the entrance to the [[Endless Stair]] had been blocked, preventing him from escaping the mountaintop. Gwaihir once again bore Gandalf; he found his burden to be as light as a feather, for Gandalf's old life had been burned away, and he had been reborn as Gandalf the White.

The Eagle brought Gandalf to [[Lothlórien]], and then at the Wizard's request he flew to seek news of [[The Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]]. [[Aragorn]] and [[Legolas]] both saw him circling above the [[Emyn Muil]]. Gwaihir returned to Gandalf with the news that [[Merry Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] had been kidnapped by Saruman's [[Orcs|Uruk-hai]].

Gwaihir and his brother [[Landroval]] led a great company of Eagles to the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] on [[March 25]], 3019. They swooped in to attack the Winged Nazgûl, but the Nazgûl fled when Sauron summoned them to fly to [[Mount Doom]] where [[Frodo Baggins]] stood at the [[Cracks of Doom]] with the [[One Ring|Ring]]. After the Ring was destroyed, Mount Doom erupted and Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] were stranded on a hill amid flowing lava and falling ash. Gandalf asked Gwaihir to bear him a final time. Accompanied by Landroval and [[Meneldor]], Gwaihir flew swiftly to Mount Doom; with his keen sight, he spotted the [[Hobbits]] through the fumes. The Eagles lifted Frodo and Sam and bore them away to safety.

== Etymology ==

The name '''''Gwaihir''''' comes from the [[Sindarin]] terms ''gwaew'' ("storm, wind") and ''hîr'' ("lord, master"), translating his name to "Wind-lord".<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. V: ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part Three: "[[The Etymologies]]"</ref>

== Abilities ==

Gwaihir had keen eyesight and was the swiftest of the Great Eagles. He was large and strong enough to carry a grown man, though he could not do so not indefinitely.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In earlier versions, his name was "Gwaewar" and he was Thorondor's (then leader of the Great Eagles) vassal. As Gwaewar, he  was called the "Lord of the Wind".<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 5: ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part Two: "Valinor and Middle-earth before The Lord of the Rings"</ref> He was also among the Eagles present to save [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from Angband.<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 9: ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Part One: The End of the Third Age, V: "The Field of Kormallen"</ref>

In [[TA 2941]], a character called "Lord of the Eagles" saved [[Thorin and Company]] from [[Wargs]] and [[Orcs]]. He later arrived in the Lonely Mountain and fought in the Battle of Five Armies.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', Chapter XVII: "[[The Clouds Burst]]"</ref>

However, it is up for debate if Gwaihir was one of the eagles that saved Thorin and Company. In the whole of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says so <ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'','' [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter IV: "[[The Field of Cormallen]]"</ref>; this implies that Gwaihir had not borne him before the years of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]].''

In the [[1977]] animated version of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 animated film)|The Hobbit]]'', though not confirmed, many fans speculate that the Lord of the Eagles is Gwaihir; he is voiced by [[wikipedia:Don Messick|Don Messick]].
=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gwaihir arrives at Isengard to rescue Gandalf. Later in ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'', Gwaihir, Landroval, and the other Great Eagles arrive at the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] and attack the Nazgûl and their fell beasts. After the destruction of the One Ring, Gwaihir bears Gandalf and rescues Frodo and Sam from the rocks of Mount Doom.

In the Hobbit Trilogy, Gandalf uses a moth to call Gwaihir and the other Great Eagles to help them escape Azog and his hunters. Later, [[Radagast]] rides Gwaihir during the [[Battle of the Five Armies]] after seeking his aid along with an army of Great Eagles.

=== Video games ===

*Gwaihir makes a brief appearance in the video game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' as a special power available to [[Berethor]]'s Company.
*Gwaihir makes an unnamed appearance in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth'' as a power to use when playing as either [[Gondor]] or [[Rohan]]. Although he is unnamed - just called an eagle - it is possible that one of the eagles would be Gwaihir.
*Gwaihir also makes a brief appearance in [[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|''The Lord of the Rings: War in the North'']] after [[Eradan (Ranger)|Eredan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (Champion)|Farin]] defeat [[Bargrisar]].
