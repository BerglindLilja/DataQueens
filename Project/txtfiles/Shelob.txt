{{quote|But still, she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.|''The Two Towers'', "[[Shelob's Lair (chapter)|Shelob's Lair]]"}}
'''Shelob''' was a great [[Spider]] and the greatest offspring of [[Ungoliant]], the primordial spider. In the [[Third Age]] she lived in [[Mordor]] and was known to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was encountered by [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] in their quest to destroy the [[One Ring]].

==History==
===Origin===

Shelob's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption that she was born in the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] and that she was the "last child" of Ungoliant. By the [[Second Age]], she often feasted on her own children, and that at some point after fleeing from [[Beleriand]], yet long before [[Sauron]] took the land of Mordor for himself she spun a dark lair in the [[Ephel Duath]] (Mountains of Shadow), near [[Cirith Ungol]] in the passes above [[Minas Morgul]]. For hundreds of years, she resided there making a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her prey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted primarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly juicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.

===Third Age===

Sauron was aware of Shelob's presence in the mountains and allowed her to dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the passage of Cirith Ungol. Sauron was known to be somewhat fond of her, and in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his cat. Sauron would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners for which he had no more use, or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the massacre made by Shelob would be carried back to [[Barad-dûr]] to further please the Dark Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat [[Orcs]] that manned the tower of Cirith Ungol. However, as she was a more effective guard for the pass than they, Sauron never made any serious attempt to stop her (though Orcs would occasionally try to barricade her lair with stones).

At one point after being set free from Mordor, [[Gollum]] stumbled into her lair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but he survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than he.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Book Four, Ch. IX: "[[Shelob's Lair (chapter)|Shelob's Lair]]", pp. 723</ref> Orcs of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and believed that he was too thin and wiry for Shelob to bother eating.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Book Five, Ch. X: "[[The Choices of Master Samwise]]", pgs. 738-739 </ref>

Gollum would attempt later to fulfil this promise by leading Frodo and Sam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Shelob finished eating the two hobbits, she would throw away the One Ring with the other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Gollum to retrieve it. The two hobbits eventually happened upon a passageway that was too choked with Shelob's dark cobwebs to proceed, but as fortune would have it, Frodo's sword [[Sting]], being of Elvish make, was able to slice through them. Using the [[Phial of Galadriel]], they managed to at first fend her off. The light of [[Star of Eärendil|Earendil's Star]] shone from the Phial, causing unbearable stabbing pain to Shelob's darkened senses, but she returned to attack Frodo poisoning him with her stinger in a surprise attack just as they reached the exit of the cave on the Mordor side. Her venom paralyzed Frodo, and she then wrapped him in her web.

Sam then assaulted the creature using Sting and the Phial of Galadrial in order to rescue his master. In a pitched battle, Sam managed to stab one of her eyes and injure her leg, but she held the upper hand. However, when she tried to use her stinger to inject Sam with venom, he dodged at the last moment and was able to stab her in the abdomen with Sting. This wounded her enough that Sam forced her to retreat using the Phial of Galadrial. None had ever wounded her so badly before.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Book Five, Ch. X: "[[The Choices of Master Samwise]]", pg. 729</ref>

It is not known if Shelob recovered from the battle, or if she succumbed to her wounds, as it was said her fate would remain unknown to the people of [[Middle-earth]]. She is last mentioned when Sam put on the One Ring, and heard Shelob "bubbling" in her misery far away, as his sense of hearing was vastly improved by wearing the Ring.

== Character ==
As a spawn of Ungoliant, Shelob would accurately be classified as part spider, part demon (to an unknown extent), though of a spider form. Like most spiders, Shelob had spindly legs, multiple eyes, and venomous chelicerae. She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting that enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also crush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was crisscrossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes. The Orcs comment she usually would paralyze her victims and trap them in webs, keeping them alive for some time before killing them.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
===Films===
====Ralph Bakshi's film====
Gollum indirectly mentions Shelob near the end of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|1978 film]], saying that "she might help us...", but she does not appear.

====The Lord of the Rings film trilogy====
Unlike in the books, Shelob makes her first appearance in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', rather than ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'', because (as explained) if she had appeared in ''The Two Towers'', there would be very little for [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] to encounter in the final film. In this adaptation, Shelob appears as a CGI animated creature, roughly eight feet in length and seventeen feet across.

===Video games===
====The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest====
Shelob is an optional boss in the Wii and PS3 versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'', but only fought as an imaginary enemy in the Shire overworld's Mushroom Woods.  This optional boss fight is the end of a side quest available in the afternoon where [[Frodo Gamgee]] re-enacts Frodo's perilous journey to her lair.

====Middle-earth: Shadow of War ====
[[File:Shelob in Shadow of War.png|thumb|220x220px|Shelob as she appears in ''Middle-earth: Shadow of War'']]
Shelob, in ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]],'' is visible in human form in the wraith-world. In the game, she has [[Celebrimbor]]'s [[The New Ring|ring]] for quite some time while giving [[Talion]] visions about the fate of [[Minas Ithil]] (Minas Morgul) and the [[Ringwraiths]]. It is also seen in the game that Shelob was working with Sauron during the period he was posing as Annatar, and was implied to be his lover before he betrayed her. The mobile version of ''Shadow of War'' classifies Shelob as a [[Maiar|Maia]], though [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] never specified her exact nature.   
====The Lord of the Rings Online====
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Shelob.jpg|thumb|300px|Shelob in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
In [[The Lord of the Rings Online|''The Lord of the Rings Online'']], Shelob is known to [[Elves]] as "Ungwetári" and Lord [[Celeborn]] had hunted her down in the early years of the [[Third Age]], to no avail. Shelob has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by [[Samwise]] she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with [[spiders]] such as [[Mirkwood]] become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Shelob herself is depicted as much larger than in the movie or other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Shelob herself is the last boss in the main raid of the [[Minas Morgul]] expansion.
