'''Círdan''', also known as '''Nowë '''and '''Círdan the Shipwright''', was one of the highest and most noble of the [[Sindar]], Lord of the [[Falathrim]] during the [[First Age]], and Master of the [[Grey Havens]] through the [[Second Age|Second]], [[Third Age|Third]], and [[Fourth Age]]. He was one of the wisest and most foresighted of the [[Elves]], and by the [[Second Age]] the oldest known [[Elves|elf]] in [[Middle-earth]], to remain so throughout that age and into the [[Fourth Age]] as well.  He was also gifted [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]], by [[Celebrimbor]] until he surrendered it to [[Gandalf]].  He was one of the last elves in Middle-earth, sailing West at an unknown length of time after the death of [[King Elessar]] in FO 120.

==Biography==
===First Age===
====Early history ====

Círdan, born '''Nowë''', was kin of both [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]], lords in the host of the former.<ref name=":0">''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XII: ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Part Two, chapter XIII: "Last Writings", "Círdan", note 30</ref> Cirdan was said to have been one of the most skilled Elves in building ships during the [[Great Journey]], especially when the Elves dwelt by the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref name=":0" /> During the push westward, seeking to go to [[Valinor]], Nowë and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.  Despite Nowë's great eagerness to see the light of Valinor (his "greatest desire"), he loyally searched for Elwë upon his disappearance.  Because of this, the [[Teleri]] missed the first trip on [[Tol Eressëa]] to [[Valinor]], on which went their kin, the [[Noldor]] and the [[Vanyar]].  They took for their king [[Olwë]], and while waiting for [[Ulmo]] to return for them, Nowë headed the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession, he took the name "Círdan" which means "shipwright" in [[Sindarin]]. The Teleri also developed a great friendship with [[Ossë]].  At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, Círdan sought Elwë longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.

Because of this, Círdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eressëa.  He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eressëa as it vanished into the West over [[Belegaer]].  Then he cried aloud:

But into his heart came a message from the [[Valar]] which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work be of utmost worth, remembered in song. Círdan answered in obeyance and saw a vision of [[Vingilot|a ship]].

====Foundation and Return of the Noldor====
Círdan, therefore, remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Ossë, and became their lord.  The folk became known as the [[Falathrim]], "''people of the foaming shore''", and dwelt in the [[Falas]] by the sea.  There they built many ships, and the cities [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], and found pearls which they sent to their overlord, King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], who was once Elwë.

When [[Morgoth]] broke forth in the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] in [[YT 1497]], Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol’s aid.  Further, although Thingol conquered with the help of the [[Laiquendi]], the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the return of the Noldor when [[Fëanor]] struck [[Morgoth]] from the north.  The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the [[Orcs]] were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by [[Celegorm]].  The Falas were saved.

Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor, and quite possibly met and befriended his later neighbours and friends [[Turgon]] and [[Finrod]].  Although Turgon eventually moved from [[Vinyamar]] to faraway [[Gondolin]], Círdan’s friendship with Finrod was lasting, and Círdan became a close advisor to the Noldor.  Círdan was, after all, a relative of his, being related (probably quite closely) to Olwë, Finrod’s grandfather.

====Early First Age====
When the tales began spreading (sown by [[Morgoth]]) of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying of Alqualondë]], Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumours sprouted from great malice.  Knowing the jealousy and dissension among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers.  Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard.  This resulted in the banishment of [[Quenya]] and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.

Círdan may have assisted in the [[Dagor Aglareb]], but this is unknown.  He did not take part in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], as he was far away and not directly attacked, if even he had time to come to the aid of his allies.  Nevertheless, Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the second assault on Hithlum, coming to the timely aid of [[Fingon]] when he was most needed.  They sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]], then struck the unsuspecting [[orcs]] from the west, giving victory to the elves.

After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], many fugitives came for shelter in the Falas.  The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea.  But it was only a matter of time before [[Morgoth]] attacked.  Then came the disastrous Fall of the Falas. Though both [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the power of the Dark Lord's armies.  The elves fought valiantly, but the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved.  [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste.  But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him [[Gil-galad]], one of the last of the princes of the Noldor.  They came to the [[Isle of Balar]] and founded a new kingdom, but kept a foothold at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], keeping ships hidden in the reeds there, making a refuge for all who fled there.

====Lord of Balar====
Turgon, receiving the dreadful news of the Havens fall, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek [[Valinor]] and the aid of the [[Valar]].  Círdan built seven swift ships and sent them westward.  None returned, save for only one mariner of the [[Gondolindrim]].  The way to the West was closed.

Eventually, Círdan served as messenger, when [[Ulmo]] delivered him a message for [[Orodreth]], warning of the doom of [[Nargothrond]], and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge.  The warning went unheeded, resulting in the Fall of Nargothrond.

After news came to Balar of the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Gil-galad]] was proclaimed [[High King of the Ñoldor|High King of the Noldor]].  Círdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf [[Eärendil]] son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him.  Círdan aided Eärendil in building the ship [[Vingilot]], giving him advice and help.  Círdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.

Círdan and Gil-galad came with their armies from the Isle of Balar too late to prevent the disastrous [[Third Kinslaying]] when the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] were ambushed and many fell.  But Eärendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the [[Silmaril]] of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] had been spirited away by [[Elwing]] his wife.  Thus, wielding the Silmaril, Eärendil came to [[Valinor]] and found the forgiveness of the [[Valar]]. From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the elves, perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of [[Glorfindel]], who also contributed significantly).  After the [[War of Wrath]], Círdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart’s desire and going West, but with a small following remained in [[Middle-earth]].

===Second Age===
The continents were shifted, but Círdan still took up his abode by the sea, at the [[Grey Havens]], which the Elves built in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]] whence the [[Eldar]] could sail the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there. There he welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen [[Númenóreans]], making friends with [[Vëantur]], chief of the mariners of [[Tar-Elendil]], and later teaching [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] of ships (both management and construction) and port architecture, doubtless being the foremost authority on both.

Círdan advised against the creation of the [[Rings of Power]] when [[Sauron|Annatar]] came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the joy and enthusiasm of the [[Eregion]] elves, and especially [[Celebrimbor]]. Nevertheless, when the [[Three Rings]] escaped the Sack of Eregion, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them. He received [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Sauron]], having revealed himself in the destruction of Eregion and empowered by [[the One Ring]] he had forged, invaded [[Eriador]] in the same blow; however, his attempt to take [[Mithlond]] and [[Lindon]] failed with the intervention of the [[Númenóreans]] sent by [[Tar-Minastir]].

Círdan joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and fought as the lieutenant of [[Gil-galad]]. Many fell there, including [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]]. After the battle, with Elrond, he urged [[Isildur]], Elendil’s first-born, to throw the captured One Ring into [[Orodruin]], where it would be unmade, but Isildur refused. 

===Third Age===
After the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the death of Gil-galad, Cirdan ruled over Lindon from the [[Grey Havens]]. For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed, but at around [[TA 1050]], a shadow began to lengthen.  Though many deemed that Sauron was defeated forever, for the first time in many centuries some evil was stirring, and awake.  It was at this time the [[Istari]], sent by the [[Valar]], came. He was the most foresighted of all of them, and alone knew the true purpose of the Istari. He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him [[Narya]], his greatest possession albeit one that he had seldom used.

Throughout the [[Angmar War]], the Elves of Lindon under [[Cirdan]] supported the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]. With Círdan’s help, King [[Araphor]] drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]] in [[TA 1409]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.

In [[TA 1975]], Elven sailors from Lindon brought a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue the lost king [[Arvedui]].  The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished when the ship foundered.  That year, Círdan and the elves joined with the forces of [[Gondor]] and the remaining Northern Dúnedain in the victorious [[Battle of Fornost]]. Later, Círdan took control of the abandoned [[palantíri|Elendil Stone]] in [[Elostirion]] on the [[Tower Hills]], which could gaze into the [[Tol Eressëa|lost west]] and was without a link to the other ''palantíri''.

Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the [[War of the Ring]] in [[TA 3018]] and later [[TA 3021]]. [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was his messenger to [[Rivendell]] and attended the [[Council of Elrond]], speaking with authority on his lord’s behalf.

The last mention of Círdan came with the end of the Third Age.  When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, Círdan greeted them before the gates.  Although [[Gandalf]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]] passed west on the ship he had built for them, Círdan seems to have remained for a time.  

Círdan maintained the haven at least into the [[Fourth Age]], but it was recognized that eventually, its purpose would reach an end when no more Elves wished to cross the [[Sea]]. At that time, Círdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the [[Straight Road]] himself. After an unknown length of time in the Fourth Age, he sailed west aboard the last ship with the last [[High Elves]], taking with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.

==Characteristics==
In the last years of the Third Age, Círdan appeared very old save for his eyes which "''were keen as stars''", wearing a long beard. Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his third cycle of life.

==Significance==
Círdan had a profound effect on the course of Middle-earth's history. He was a loyal servant and friend of [[Elwë]], sacrificing his heart’s desire in search of him. This loyalty and sense of duty shows up numerous times over the course of history, including his second sacrifice in his submission to the [[Valar]], and his sending of troubling and potentially destructive rumours to his overlord Thingol. He was also the most foresighted of the elves, a gift from the Valar. He conceivably saved Elven civilization with the founding of the havens at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], and with the fostering of both [[Gil-galad]] and [[Eärendil]]. His precious gift of [[Narya]] to [[Gandalf]] was also timely and valuable.  He was clearly favoured by [[Ulmo]], seen by the number of messages passed through him.

==Etymology==

'''''Círdan''''' was a [[Sindarin]] word that meant 'Ship-maker', and the [[Quenya]] form was said to be '''''Ciryatan'''''. His original name was probably '''''Nowë''''', which may be related to the term ''nowo'' meaning "think, form idea, imagine."

==Portrayal in adaptations==
===Lord of the Rings film trilogy===

[[File:Cirdan.jpg|thumb|250px|Círdan in [[The Return of the King film|''The Return of the King'' film]]]]

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' movie trilogy, Círdan briefly appears in the first and third movies, played by [[Michael Elsworth]]. His role as lieutenant of Gil-galad is given to Elrond instead (Elrond was [[Gil-galad]]'s herald in the books) in the first movie. He does, however, appear very briefly during [[Galadriel's Messages|Galadriel's]] Monologue at the start of the first movie, in a brief shot of the three Elven ring-bearers - and at the end of the third movie when [[Frodo]], [[Galadriel]], Elrond, [[Gandalf]] and [[Bilbo]] board the ship at the Grey Havens, Círdan is seen standing in the background.

===The Lord of the Rings Online===
[[File:Círdan - LOTRO.jpg|thumb|Círdan in ''The Lord of the Rings Online''|alt=]]
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Círdan appears in several flashbacks depicting the the [[War of the Last Alliance]].
