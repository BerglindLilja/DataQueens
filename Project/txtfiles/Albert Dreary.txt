In [[TA 2940]], when [[Thorin Oakenshield]] came to [[Bree]] to have a visit at the inn of the [[Prancing Pony]] after failing to find his father [[Thráin II|Thráin]] in [[Dunland]], Albert went out of a pub looking drunk, and ate the tip of a carrot before he departed.

=== The Fellowship of the Ring ===
Many years later in [[TA 3018]], when [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] went to visit the inn to meet with [[Gandalf]], Albert appeared once again eating a carrot and belched as they went past him.

== Trivia ==
When [[Peter Jackson]] was playing Albert in [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] he originally was smoking a pipe. However after a few takes he felt sick of the smoke, and so instead used a carrot. He did the same in his next appearance. 

Albert Dreary was portrayed Jackson in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', who was the director of the film series. His name was identified at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and in the [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] card game.
