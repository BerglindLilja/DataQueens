{{Term/Store|Floor Spike|Floor Spikes|Series, PH|plural}},{{Exp Game|PH}} also known as {{Term/Store|Spike Trap|Spike Traps|CoH|plural}},{{Exp Game|CoH}}<ref>{{Cite|Defeated By: Spike Trap|Game Over|CoH}}</ref>, are recurring traps in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|I don't think you can get through these {{Color|ST Light Blue|floor spikes}}, Link. Leave it to me! I'll figure something out!|Princess Zelda|ST}}</ref>{{Name Ref|ALttP, LA, LADX, OoT, OoT3D, OoS, OoA, TWW, TWWHD, FSA, TP, TPHD, PH, SS, TFH, BotW}} {{Plural|Series|Floor Spikes}} go unnamed in {{TMC}}.

==Characteristics==
==={{ALttP|-}}===
{{Plural|ALttP|Floor Spikes}} can be avoided by using the {{Term|ALttP|Magic Cape|link}} in {{ALttP}}, as {{Term|ALttP|Link|link}} can walk directly over them without taking damage. The {{Term|ALttP|Magic Cape}} is necessary to obtain the {{Term|ALttP|Cane of Byrna|link}}, as it is preceded by a number of {{Plural|ALttP|Floor Spikes}} that {{Term|ALttP|Link}} would be unable to traverse safely otherwise.

==={{LA|-}}===
{{Stub|LA}}

==={{OoT|-}}===
Many {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}} are found inside the {{Term|OoT3D|Water Temple|link}} in {{OoT}}, typically blocking passage until the water level rises. In the {{Term|OoT3D|Shadow Temple|link}}, certain {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}} are invisible, requiring that {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} use the {{Term|OoT3D|Lens of Truth|link}} in order to see them. The {{Term|OoT3D|Hover Boots|link}} can also be used to walk above {{Plural|OoT3D|Floor Spikes}}, momentarily avoiding damage, while the {{Term|OoT3D|Goron Tunic|link}} causes {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} to take damage less frequently from them.

==={{OoS|-}}===
In {{OoS}}, in order to defeat {{Term|OoS|Dodongo|link}}, the {{Term|OoS|Boss|link}} from the {{Term|OoS|Snake's Remains|link}}, {{Term|OoS|Link|link}} must toss it onto the {{Plural|OoS|Floor Spikes}} found in the center of the room after stunning it with a {{Term|OoS|Bomb|link}}.

==={{OoA|-}}===
{{Stub|OoA}}

==={{TWW|-}}===
{{Plural|TWWHD|Floor Spikes}} appear in the {{Term|TWWHD|Forsaken Fortress|link}} and the {{Term|TWWHD|Wind Temple|link}} in {{TWW}}, though in the former they are unable to damage {{Term|TWWHD|Link|link}} and serve only to obstruct his path. In both {{Plural|TWWHD|Dungeon|link}}, the {{Plural|TWWHD|Floor Spikes}} can usually be retracted once a certain puzzle is solved or all enemies in the area have been defeated.

==={{FSA|-}}===
{{Stub|FSA}}

==={{TMC|-}}===
{{Plural|TMC|Floor Spikes}} appear in {{Plural|TMC|Dungeon|link}} and other {{Plural|TMC|Cave|link}} across {{Term|TMC|Hyrule|link}} in {{TMC}}, both while {{Term|TMC|Link}} is regular-sized and {{Term|TMC|Minish|link}}-sized. They will damage {{Term|TMC|Link|link}} if he touches them, though they can be leapt over by using {{Term|TMC|Roc's Cape|link}}.

==={{TP|-}}===
{{Plural|TPHD|Floor Spikes}} appear within the {{Term|TPHD|Arbiter's Grounds (Dungeon)|link}} in {{TP}}, where they emerge from holes in the floor when {{Term|TPHD|Link}} approaches. Several of their locations are also concealed by {{Term|TPHD|Quicksand|link}}, making it difficult to judge their position and maneuver around them. When they are above the ground, however, {{Term|TPHD|Link}} is able to destroy them permanently using {{Plural|TPHD|Bomb}}.

==={{PH|-}}===
{{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} appear inside {{Plural|PH|Dungeon|link}} in {{PH}}, where they serve to impede {{Term|PH|Link|link}}'s progress and will damage him on contact. {{Term|PH|Link}} can usually deactivate them by defeating enemies and solving puzzles. {{Plural|PH|Phantom|link}} are able to move over {{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} without taking damage. Some {{Plural|PH|Floor Spikes}} move up and down intermittently, forcing {{Term|PH|Link}} to pass over them quickly while they are briefly inactive.

==={{ST|-}}===
{{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}} appear inside {{Plural|ST|Dungeon|link}} in {{ST}}, where they serve to impede {{Term|ST|Link|link}}'s progress and will damage him on contact. {{Term|ST|Link}} can usually deactivate them by defeating enemies and solving puzzles. As {{Plural|ST|Phantom|link}} are unaffected by {{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}}, {{Term|ST|Princess Zelda|link}} can also harness this immunity when she gains the ability to possess {{Plural|ST|Phantom}}, and use it to cross over the {{Plural|ST|Floor Spikes}} and help solve puzzles normally out of {{Term|ST|Link}}'s reach.

==={{SS|-}}===
{{Plural|SS|Floor Spikes}} appear within a single room inside the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Mining Facility|link}} in {{SS}}, where they are stealthily concealed by large amounts of sand. They activate quickly when {{Term|SS|Link|link}} draws near. This requires {{Term|SS|Link}} to work his way through the maze-like room by using the {{Term|SS|Gust Bellows|link}} to blow away the sand and find a safe path.

==={{TFH|-}}===
{{Plural|TFH|Floor Spikes}} appear in the {{Term|TFH|Frozen Plateau|link}} level of the {{Term|TFH|Drablands|link}} in {{TFH}}. Here, fireballs can be bounced across them using the {{Term|TFH|Fire Gloves|link}}, which are used to light {{Plural|TFH|Torch|link}} and defeat enemies that are otherwise out of reach.

==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Stub|BotW}}
{{Plural|BotW|Floor Spikes}} are typically found within {{Plural|BotW|Ancient Shrine|link}}.
