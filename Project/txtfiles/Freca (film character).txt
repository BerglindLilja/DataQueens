'''Freca'''<ref name=colnect>http://colnect.com/en/trading_card_games/trading_card_game/17306-•Freca_Hungry_Savage-Reflection-Lord_of_The_Rings</ref> was a [[Dunlending]] Chieftain in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' who allied himself with the wizard [[Saruman]]. 

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
===Peter Jackson's The Two Towers=== 

Summoned at [[Orthanc]], Freca was persuaded by Saruman to join with the growing power of [[Sauron]] in a bid to weaken the kingdom of [[Rohan]]. Agreeing to the pact, Freca swore a blood oath of allegiance to Saruman, cutting his hand with a knife.  Presumably, he then led Dunlending raids against Rohan.
