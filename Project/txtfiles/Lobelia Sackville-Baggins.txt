'''Lobelia (Bracegirdle) Sackville-Baggins''' was a [[Hobbit]] of the [[Shire]].

== Biography ==

Lobelia married [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]], and had a son, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]]. Lobelia was known to be a covetous and grasping hobbit, and had designs on [[Bag End]], as Otho was [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s paternal first cousin and next of kin. During Bilbo's disappearance, Lobelia and Otho claimed the smial; when Bilbo returned from his adventure with [[Thorin and Company]], Lobelia and Otho were in the midst of auctioning off the contents of Bag End with the firm of [[Grubb]], Grubb and Burrowes.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]],'' Chapter XVIII: "[[The Return Journey]]"</ref>

After Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, Lobelia and Otho were incensed that Bilbo had left Bag End to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], a more distant cousin once removed, and questioned the validity of Bilbo's will. Since much of Bilbo's [[silver]]ware vanished during his adventure with the Dwarves, when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labeled "For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo", as a [[mathom]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter I: "[[A Long-expected Party (chapter)|A Long-expected Party]]"</ref> Eventually, Lobelia was able to acquire Bag End when Frodo sold it to her for under market value under his ruse of moving to [[Crickhollow]], but by this time Otho had died and was unable to enjoy it.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter III: "[[Three is Company]]"</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], Lobelia opposed [[Saruman|Sharkey]] after hearing from the [[Ruffians]] that they were ordered to build sheds at Bag End. After rudely telling her to step aside, she became enraged and attacked the leader using only her umbrella as a weapon but she lost and was imprisoned in the [[Lockholes]] at [[Michel Delving]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref> Freed after the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Lobelia was greeted with raucous applause due to her spirit in defying Saruman's thuggery, and she was touched as she had never before been popular due to her avarice. However, she was heartbroken over Lotho's murder, and so granted Bag End back to Frodo and what was left of her money hoping he would use it to help hobbits who had lost their homes, due to Sharkey's tyranny. She moved in with her original family, the [[Bracegirdle]]s of [[Hardbottle]]. She died in the spring of 3020, and was over 100 years old.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter IX: "[[The Grey Havens]]"</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== Films ===

Lobelia was portrayed by [[Elizabeth Moody]] in the extended edition of the film adaptation ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001). She is mentioned during the beginning of ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' (2012) when Frodo tells Bilbo about Lobelia's and Otho's still wanting to own [[Bag End]], and when Bilbo replies that she once stole a handful of his utensils, and tells Frodo to watch over her. However, Lobelia appears in the extended edition of the film (played by [[Erin Banks]]) walking with her husband at the market near the [[Green Dragon Inn]]. She and Otho appear briefly at the end of ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' (2014), when Bilbo arrives back during the auction and firmly takes back a set of spoons that she had been leaving Bag End with.
