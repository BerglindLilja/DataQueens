The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell.",

His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it. ",

        " Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise can not see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. ",

        " And what did you tell him? Speak! ",
        " What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? ",
        " There was no lie in Pippin’s eyes. A fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We’ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the palantír a glimpse of the enemy’s plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm’s Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still,strength perhaps to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of Men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war. ",
        " No!",
        " They will be. ",
        " Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry, hurry! ",
        " Three days’ ride, as the Nazgûl flies, and you better hope we don’t have one of those on our tail. ",
        " Run Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste! ",

        " Minas Tirith. City of kings. ",
        " Make way! ",
        " Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The tree of the king. Lord Denethor, however, is not king. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. ",
        " Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir’s father. To give him news of his beloved son’s death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, it’s better if you don’t speak at all, Peregrin Took. ",
        " Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. ",
        " Pippin! ",
        " Get up!  My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor’s armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. ",
        " Authority is not given you to deny the return of the king, Steward. ",
        "  Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. And the White Tree, the tree of the king, will never bloom again.",
        " They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was, before it fell into decay. The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living, and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons.  Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of kings failed. The White Tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. ",
        " This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron’s making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin. ",
        " Oh, it’s too late for that, Peregrin. There’s no leaving this city. Help must come to us.",
        " ",
        " Ridiculous Hobbit. Guard of the Citadel.  Thank you.",
        " Yes.   ",
        " It’s the deep breath before the plunge. ",
        " There never was much hope. Just a fool’s hope. Our Enemy is ready. His full strength gathered.  Not only Orcs, but Men as well. Legions of Haradrim from the south. Mercenaries from the coast. All will answer Mordor’s call. This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer-stroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defense of this city will be gone. ",
        "  He is the lord of the Nazgûl, the greatest of the Nine. Minas Morgul is his lair. ",
        " We come to it at last. The great battle of our time. ",
        " The board is set. The pieces are moving. ",
        " Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me. ",

        " Back to the gate! Hurry! ",
        " Steady. Steady! ",
        " You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. ",

        " End? No, the journey doesn’t end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it. ",

        " No. No, it isn’t. ",
        " Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. ",
        " It’s only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. ",
        " Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.  I’ve sent him to his death. ",
        "  Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. ",
        " We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this: The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return.",
