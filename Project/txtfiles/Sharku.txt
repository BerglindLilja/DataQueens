{{Quote|He's dead. Took a little tumble off the cliff.|Sharku to Legolas and Gimli, about Aragorn}}
'''Sharku''' was an [[Orc]] veteran from [[Isengard]] who led [[Saruman]]'s [[Warg-Riders|Warg-riders]]. He only appears in the [[The Two Towers (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Two Towers (novel)|The Two Towers]]''.

While the character is unique to [[Peter Jackson]]'s films, his name is derived from an original footnote in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' stating that [[Saruman]]'s nickname "Sharkey" to be a corruption of the word ''sharku'', meaning 'old man'.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Return of the King,'' Book Six, Chapter VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref>

== Appearances ==
=== Film ===

[[File:Sharkutoppic.jpg|thumb|175px|Sharku during the attack on Rohan]]In the second film of [[Peter Jackson]]'s film trilogy, Sharku is sent by Saruman with a large group of [[Isengard Orcs]] on Wargs to attack the people of Rohan who are trying to reach the fortress of [[Helm's Deep]]. [[Aragorn]] has a short struggle with Sharku on his [[warg]], where, as Sharku tries to knock him off the Warg, Sharku is stabbed in the chest by Aragorn's [[Elven]] knife. The Warg, in an attempt to throw Aragorn off, gallops towards the ledge of a cliff. Sharku then falls off his Warg and is trampled. Aragorn becomes stuck to the Warg's saddle and tumbles to his supposed death. Unable to find Aragorn, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] threaten a dying Sharku who reveals Aragorn's fate before expiring.

He was acted by Peter Jackson's friend [[Jed Brophy]]. 

In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s books, Warg-riders or wolf-riders are occasionally alluded to, but no leader is specified.
