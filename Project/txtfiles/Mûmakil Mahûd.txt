The '''Mûmakil Mahûd''' or '''Chief of the Mûmakil''' led the other [[Haradrim]] and Mûmakil-riders into battle at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. He killed many of the [[Riders of Rohan]] at the battle, while riding a Mûmak, but eventually met his demise at the hands of [[Éomer]], who was able to hurl a spear into his chest.

The Chief of the Mûmakil's real name is not known, and he is not a specified character in the books; he was invented for [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'' film. The name ''Mûmakil Mahûd'' or ''Mahûd'' was an invention of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]''. He is also depicted as a ''Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game'' miniature.
