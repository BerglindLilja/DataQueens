'''Lurtz''' was the first leader of the [[Uruk-hai Scouts|Uruk-hai scouts]] created specifically for [[Peter Jackson]]'s movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He was portrayed by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Lawrence Makoare]].

He is non-canonical as he was created for the films, and is not in the [[The Lord of the Rings|books]].

Lurtz was the first of [[Saruman]]'s [[Uruk-hai]] to be bred, choking the first Orc he sees to death within seconds of his birth. Attempting to intervene, other Orcs ([[Snagae|Snaga]]) move towards the newly born Uruk-hai warrior, but Saruman halts their advance, intrigued by the malice and violence present in the Uruk's blood, leaving the unfortunate Orc to its fate. He became Saruman's second-in-command, and led the first battalion of Uruk-hai into battle against the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] at [[Amon Hen]].

[[File:Lurtz_Final_Blow.png|thumb|270px|Lurtz moves to finish off Boromir before Aragorn intervenes|alt=]]

In the books, [[Boromir]] was slain by Orc archers, described as having been "pierced by many arrows".<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Ch. I, "[[The Departure of Boromir]]"</ref> In the movie, he is killed by Lurtz, who shoots him three times in the shoulder, stomach, and chest after chasing the Fellowship to [[Parth Galen]].

As his soldiers grab [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] and leave the scene, Lurtz slowly approaches the wounded Boromir to finish him off, but [[Aragorn]], who had heard Boromir's horn, intervenes and tackles Lurtz to the ground, and both begin a brutal fight. In the struggle, Lurtz's incredible ferocity and brutality appear to rival Aragorn's skill and resourcefulness, but after a dangerous bout, Aragorn manages to sever Lurtz's arms and decapitate him. Boromir dies minutes later, after speaking with Aragorn.

The duel between Lurtz and Aragorn was directed by producer [[Barrie Osborne]].<ref>([[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]], Extended Edition appendices) [[Part Two: From Vision to Reality]], Filming ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', ''[[Cameras in Middle-earth]]'', 45:00</ref>

== Character ==

Of all [[Uruk-hai]] bred in [[Isengard]], Lurtz was probably the smartest, and bravest, and the most capable leader. He is intelligent, extremely violent, and blindly loyal to Saruman. The only notable personality trait he displays is a high tolerance to pain, although he noticeably growls in pain when Aragorn stabs him through the leg with his dagger and when he pulls the dagger out of his leg, but doesn't feel it when his arm is sliced off. When stabbed through the stomach, he pulls the sword deeper into his body, closer to Aragorn to taunt him and in a last ditched effort to kill him - this shows that Lurtz has ultimate perseverance and tolerance for the odds.

He was a highly skilled swordsman who had an unorthodox, brute fighting style involving long-range attacks and close-range brawling moves. He held his own against [[Aragorn]], managing to keep up with him for a period of time, landing several blows upon him and even making him bleed. However, he was eventually overpowered and slain by Aragorn due to the latter's superior skill and technique. Lurtz also had the skill of an archer.

Lurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the original film; it is only known from the franchise and credits. However, in the extended edition of the film, Lurtz's name is spoken by Saruman.

He also appears as a playable character in the RPG's [[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|''The Lord of the Rings: Conquest'']] and ''[[LEGO The Lord of the Rings]]'' after he is unlocked.

He made an appearance in ''[[The Two Towers (game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers''' ''']]''[[The Two Towers (game)|video game]] as one of the bosses in the [[Amon Hen]] level.

Lurtz makes an appearance in the GBA Game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA)|The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' as a playable hero for the forces of evil.

== Toys ==
In the LEGO game ''Battle of Helm's Deep'', a Lurtz microfigure is presented, named "[[Uruk-Hai|Uruk-hai]] Leader". 

In [[LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game|''LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game'']], there is a playable character actually named "Lurtz" along with his newborn variation obtained through obtaining 100% completion. In this game, Lurtz kills Boromir by throwing a banana in his chest. 

The LEGO kit "The Orc Forge" includes the Lurtz minifigure, alone of all LEGO kits. [[File:ABC.jpg|thumb|220x220px|LEGO Lurtz]]

== Trivia ==
*Lurtz was played by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Lawrence Makoare]]. Such was the size of Lawrence, that he did not have to wear the extensive amounts of padding as the other Uruk-hai actors did, needing only the minimum to give him the features of an Uruk-hai warrior.
*Because [[Lawrence Makoare|Lawrence Makoare's]] vision was impaired while he was made-up to look like Lurtz, he could not pull punches during the sequence when he battles Aragorn in hand-to-hand-combat. Rather than having Makoare do the sequence over until he could pull his punches, Viggo Mortensen decided to fight back just as realistically - making the physical blows completely real.
**The Uruk-hai make-up also caused Makoare to throw Aragorn's dagger directly back at Viggo, even though he was supposed to try and miss. Viggo managed to deflect the knife with his sword, which made it into the final cut of the film.
* In ''The Battle for Middle-earth'', Lurtz has the ability to shoot an enemy hero with an arrow that roots them to the ground, much like Boromir's inability to move after being shot by him in the film.
