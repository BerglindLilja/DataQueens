'''Hamfast "The Gaffer" Gamgee''' was a [[Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], gardener by trade and father of [[Samwise Gamgee]].

== Biography ==

Hamfast was the son of [[Hobson Gamgee|Hobson "Roper" Gamgee]]. He married [[Bell Goodchild]], with whom he had six children, including Samwise Gamgee, his youngest son. He was a gardener on the [[Baggins]] property at [[Bag End]] for many years. He was frequently consulted for his knowledge of root vegetables (generally over a pint at the local [[inn]]), and was seen as a particular authority on the growing of potatoes. As the time of [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s [[Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party|birthday party]] drew near, he was also in demand for his stories of Bilbo and his family. He didn't particularly like [[Sandyman]] the miller.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. I: "[[A Long-expected Party]]"</ref>

On the evening that [[Frodo Baggins]] left Bag End, the Gaffer encountered a [[Black Rider]] asking about Frodo. He told the Rider that Frodo had gone to [[Bucklebury]]. He later reported the conversation to his son Sam, who in turn told Frodo about it.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. III: "[[Three is Company]]"</ref>

During the troubles fomented by [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]], the Gaffer was turned out of his hole at Number Three, [[Bagshot Row]], as Sam saw in [[Galadriel]]'s [[The Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]]. [[Farmer Cotton]] helped look after him, sharing food, although this was against the Rules that the Chief and later [[Sharkey]] made up. When Sam arrived back in the Shire, the Gaffer was rather disbelieving of his son's adventures and disapproved of Sam's wearing "ironmongery." Once the Shire had been cleaned up, the Gaffer was restored to Number Three of the new, brick-lined holes in the hill where he was well-looked after by [[Widow Rumble]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']], Book Six, Ch. VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref><ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']], Book Six, Ch. IX: "[[The Grey Havens]]"</ref> He would live there until his death in [[SR 1428]].

==Behind the scenes==

The word '''Gaffer''' means "the chief electrician in a film production". It is also a historical and contemporary British colloquialism that refers to an overseer or boss, who is often older than his subordinates. (Tolkien was more likely thinking of the latter definition when he gave Sam's father his nickname.)
