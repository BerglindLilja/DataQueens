{{quote|I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way.|Frodo, at the Council of Elrond, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''}}
'''Frodo Baggins''', son of [[Drogo Baggins]], was a [[hobbit]] of the [[Shire]] in the late [[Third Age]]. He was, and still is, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s most renowned character for his leading role in the [[Quest of the Ring]], in which he bore the [[One Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]], where it was destroyed. He was a [[Ring-bearer]], best friend to his gardener, [[Samwise Gamgee]], and one of the three hobbits who sailed from [[Middle-earth]] to [[Aman|the Uttermost West]] at the end of the [[Third Age]].

== History ==
=== Childhood ===

Much of Frodo's youth was spent at [[Brandy Hall]] in [[Buckland]], the ancestral home of the [[Brandybuck]] family, including his mother ([[Primula (Brandybuck) Baggins|Primula Brandybuck]]). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin (Pippin) Took]] and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from [[Farmer Maggot]]'s farm [[Bamfurlong]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. IV: "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]"</ref>  

In [[TA 2980]], when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the [[Brandywine River]]. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old "uncle" [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] adopted him in [[TA 2989]]. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at [[Bag End]] and made him his heir.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. I: "[[A Long-expected Party]]"</ref>

[[File:Frodo_Baggins_with_Bilbo.png|thumb|220x220px|Frodo with Bilbo during his 111th birthday]]

The two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of the [[Elvish]] language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, [[September 22]] by [[Shire Reckoning]] (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held at the beginning of [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the peculiar year of 111.

Bilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.

Before departing for his journey to [[Rivendell]], Bilbo had a long conversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.

=== Coming of age & flight from the Shire ===
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_Gandalf_Tells.png|thumb|left|220x220px|[[Gandalf]] telling Frodo the story about the [[One Ring]]]]

After the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring. [[Gandalf]], ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit against the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied with the [[Wizards|wizard]]'s request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on [[April 12]], [[TA 3018|3018]], Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the Ring was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord [[Sauron]] needed to rule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the Ring, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to Rivendell.

After Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was encouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at [[Crickhollow]]. With the exception of his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam Gamgee]], who had agreed to accompany him to [[Rivendell]], Frodo told the other Hobbits of the Shire that he intended to move to [[Buckland]]. He sold his home to the [[Sackville-Baggins]], and, on the [[September 23]], 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and Pippin. They left in the early morning for [[Bree]], and just in time, as Sauron's most powerful servants, the nine [[Nazgûl]], had entered the Shire dressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.

==== To Bree ====
Frodo was nearly captured by a Black Rider on the road, but was saved by [[Gildor Inglorion]], whom he asked for advice. Leaving the roads to cut across country, Frodo and Sam reached Farmer Maggot's farm, who helped them to evade the Riders. Meeting Merry at [[Bucklebury Ferry]], they saw a Rider tracking them from the bank they'd departed from. On arrival at Crickhollow Frodo found that Merry and Pippin already knew about his "secret" journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Barrow-downs]] in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of [[Old Man Willow]] and the [[Barrow-wights]], but were rescued twice by [[Tom Bombadil]], a mysterious being who dwelt in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.

==== Strider ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_and_Strider.png|thumb|220x220px|Frodo meeting Strider in The Prancing Pony]]

In [[Bree]], the hobbits stayed at [[The Prancing Pony]], an old inn. Frodo went by the name of Mr [[Underhill]], attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked [[Man]] sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper, [[Barliman Butterbur]], who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], as [[Aragorn II Elessar|Strider]].

That night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search of Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself as Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a [[pony]] named [[Bill]] that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo and his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to Rivendell, and he would lead them through the [[Midgewater Marshes]] and to the hill of [[Weathertop]].

==== Weathertop ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_Stabbed.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Frodo is stabbed by the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]]'s [[Morgul-knife]]]]

On the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of the nine Ringwraiths at Weathertop. In the presence of the Nazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the [[Valar]], [[Varda|Elbereth Gilthoniel]]. Unfortunately, the leader of the Nazgûl, the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], stabbed Frodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a [[Morgul-knife]]. If it had caught him in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker and under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.

Though Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A fragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was rescued by [[Glorfindel]], an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his horse [[Asfaloth]]. They were found and pursued by the Nazgûl, as Glorfindel rode and bore Frodo swiftly to the [[Ford of Bruinen]], at the entrance to the valley of [[Rivendell]]. Once they had crossed the [[River Bruinen]], the Nine Ringwraiths behind them demanded Frodo give up the Ring, but Frodo refused. Subsequently, the Ringwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by [[Elrond]].

[[File:The_Hobbits_in_Rivendell.png|thumb|260x260px|The Hobbits reuniting in Rivendell]]

Frodo was soon healed in Rivendell by Elrond, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo awoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in [[Middle-earth]].

=== Quest of the Ring ===
==== Council of Elrond ====

[[File:Untitledhgjhg.png|thumb|left|230x230px|Frodo placing the One Ring before the Council of Elrond]]

After his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great [[Council of Elrond|Council]] that Elrond had organized. Representatives of all the [[Free Peoples of Middle-earth]] discussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One Ring must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this [[Quest of the Ring|mission]], until Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to [[Mordor]] and cast it into the [[Crack of Doom|fires]] of [[Mount Doom]]. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the [[Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship of the Ring]].

The Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, [[Boromir]] of [[Gondor]], [[Legolas]] of the [[Woodland Realm]], and [[Gimli]] of the [[Dwarves]]. Before leaving [[Rivendell]], Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made [[Bilbo's Mithril shirt|coat]] of [[mithril]] mail and his elven blade [[Sting]]. The mithril coat had been given to Bilbo by [[Thorin]] after the events of ''[[The Hobbit]],'' and Sting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On [[December 25]], the Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.

==== Moria ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_Moria.png|thumb|250x250px|The Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring prepare to battle against goblins in Moria]]

After an attack by [[White Wolves]] in [[Eregion]], on [[January 11]], [[TA 3019|3019]], the Fellowship attempted to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] (specifically the Pass of [[Caradhras]]), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]] at the urging of Gimli. 

Some days in into their dangerous trek through Moria, the Fellowship entered the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], and was attacked by Orcs and a [[cave-troll]]. Frodo helped to defeat the [[Trolls|troll]] before he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the [[Bridge of Khazad-dum]], at which Gandalf dueled [[Durin's Bane]] and fell. Once outside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and Sam to look upon the [[Kheled-zâram|Mirrormere]], even in their great hurry.

==== Lothlórien ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_with_Galadriel.png|thumb|left|245x245px|Galadriel and Frodo]]

Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of [[Lothlórien]], where they met the Lady [[Galadriel]] and Lord [[Celeborn]]. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]]. Frodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]] with the light of the star [[Eärendil]] captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with [[Lembas|elven way-bread]], other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the [[Anduin]] River.

==== The Breaking of the Fellowship ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_attacked_by_Boromir.png|thumb|220x220px|Frodo puts on the One Ring to hide from Boromir]]

The Fellowship continued their journey south to [[Parth Galen]]. There, Boromir, a [[Men of Gondor|Man of Gondor]] and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to [[Minas Tirith]] and regroup from there. When the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir followed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.

Frodo put on the Ring and escaped to the [[Seat of Seeing]], where he watched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the [[Eye of Sauron]] searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected Gandalf.

Taking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Sam's company.

The two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, Boromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the two young hobbits were then captured by [[Uruk-hai]], and were to be taken to [[Isengard]]. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their captors. The [[breaking of the Fellowship]] was now complete.

==== Emyn Muil ====
[[File:Frodo_Baggins_and_Sam_Travel.png|thumb|left|310x310px|Frodo and Sam journey towards Mordor|alt=]]

After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at [[Amon Hen]], Frodo and Sam tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the [[Emyn Muil]]. After getting lost several times, they were found by [[Gollum]], who at first tried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and into the [[Dead Marshes]].

==== The Dead Marshes ====
[[File:Frodo in the Dead Marshes.png|thumb|240x240px|Frodo during the passage of the Marshes]]
The Dead Marshes lay to the south of Emyn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.

Soon after Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum entered the Dead Marshes, a Nazgûl flew over them on a [[Fellbeast]], looking for the Ring. Gollum had led the two hobbits to a safe place that they could hide in. 

==== Ithilien ====
[[File:Frodo meets Faramir.png|left|thumb|230x230px|Frodo taken captive by Faramir's rangers]]
Gollum led the two Hobbits to the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]], as Frodo had desired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves being led by Gollum. After venturing into [[Ithilien]], and witnessing a skirmish between a company of [[Haradrim]] warriors (along with [[Oliphaunts]]) and [[Rangers of Ithilien|Rangers]] from Gondor, they were apprehended by the Ranger's captain, [[Faramir]]. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir blindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to [[Henneth Annûn]], the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Sam foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One Ring. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free, resupplying the hobbits with food for their journey. Later, Gollum was captured in the [[Forbidden Pool]] and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.

==== Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair ====
[[File:Frodo ambushed by Shelob.png|thumb|290x290px|Frodo prior to being poisoned by Shelob|alt=]]
Gollum led the hobbits past the lair of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], [[Minas Morgul]], and up the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]] into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by [[Shelob]]'s great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself safe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's webbing, Sam was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Sting and the [[Phial of Galadriel]], was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the Orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] to await further torture and questioning.

==== Cirith Ungol ====
Frodo was taken to the utmost top of the tower and imprisoned.  He was stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried. Squabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two lead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the Orcs and [[Black Uruks|Uruks]] in the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his way blocked by the [[Two Watchers]]; he eventually overcame them, entered the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the tower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying them), and entered Mordor.

==== Mordor and Mount Doom ====
Frodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the Orcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb [[Mount Doom]]. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or water, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over him grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable to go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his master rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum reappeared, and after a brief struggle, [[Sam]] cut Gollum in the stomach, and Frodo fled up the mountain.[[File:Frodo's_finger.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Frodo missing a finger]]

Inside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the ring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at its strongest, due to it being in the place of it's making. It was here that Frodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and the [[One Ring]].

[[File:Frodo_and_Sam_at_Mt_Doom.png|thumb|220x220px|Sam and Frodo after the completion of their quest]]The two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it looked as though they were doomed, [[Gwaihir]] the Lord of Eagles saw them, and with his Eagle companions [[Landroval]] and [[Meneldor]] rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to safety.

=== End of the War ===
==== The Scouring of the Shire ====

After recovering at the [[Field of Cormallen]] and witnessing the [[Crowning of King Elessar|crowning]] of Aragorn as King Elessar, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When they arrived though, they found it under the control of an individual named [[Saruman|Sharkey]] (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was ruling the Shire from [[Bag End]], although he was later murdered by [[Grima Wormtongue]]. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all the [[Shirriffs]] and townsfolk of the Shire, and they successfully defeated the [[Ruffians]] employed by Sharkey at the [[Battle of Bywater]].

Frodo was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater; instead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not going to begin there), and also that any Ruffians that surrendered were not harmed.

=== Fourth Age ===

[[File:Rings-frodofarewell.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Frodo gazes fondly at his friends as he bids them farewell at the Grey Havens]]

Following the scouring of the Shire and end of the War of the Ring in November TA 3019, Frodo, went on to serve as Deputy [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]] of the Shire. During his brief tenure he helped lead the rebuilding of the Shire, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest.  On May 1st, [[TA 3020]], Frodo attended the wedding of his best friend Sam and his wife [[Rosie Cotton]] and they moved in with him at Bag End. On mid-years day later that year, Frodo retired from his post as Mayor, letting the office revert to [[Will Whitfoot]].  During his last days in middle-earth, he tried to live as peacefully as possible. Frodo was still troubled by his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of the attack at Weathertop, in addition to falling sick on each anniversary of being stung by Shelob. As such, October 6th of that year, he would suffer from his wounds again. March 13th, [[TA 3021]] brought similar ailments, Frodo being ill from his stinging. While living with Sam and Rosie he would witness the birth of their oldest daughter [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]] twelve days later. Prior to departing Middle-earth, he also wrote his own story "The Lord of the Rings" along with Bilbo's "There and Back Again" in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].

On [[22 September|29 September]] [[SR 1421]] (Third Age), at the age of 53, Frodo joined [[Bilbo]], [[Gandalf]], [[Elrond]] and [[Galadriel]] aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea to the [[Undying Lands]], as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. 

In the year [[FO 61|61]] of the [[Fourth Age]], fellow ring-bearer and best friend Samwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands. By such a point, Frodo would have been 113 or so and his uncle would have likely passed away. Together, it was presumed they lived out the remainder of their days.

== Characteristics ==

[[File:Rotk2438.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin at the pub]]

Frodo, as described by Gandalf, was "taller than some and fairer than most, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye." (''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Chapter 10, "[[Strider (chapter)|Strider]]")'' ''He was a shy, young hobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his Brandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a hobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the Ring.
Bilbo and Frodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the opening of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Frodo and Bilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively.
Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in Hobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo traveled in ''The Hobbit'') did not fit the general content personality of most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and allowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the Ring.
The influence of the Ring and the wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the ability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway events in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of power worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.

== Attire ==

Frodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.

When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by Tom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found several long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted the Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and second when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill him.

As with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received a special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in with natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by Orcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his possessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of orcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed himself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they encountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam approached Mount Doom.
== Conception ==
Originally, Frodo was to be named Bingo Bolger-Baggins, but as the work became more serious, that name was dropped.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

There are several differences between [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy]] and the book ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (book)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. In the movies, Frodo seems to have owned the Ring for only a few days or perhaps a few months before Gandalf returned, as opposed to the seventeen years of the book. Frodo never sells Bag End, but sets out early next morning with Sam. Merry and Pippin run into the pair at the farm of Farmer Maggot and are pulled into the journey. The Hobbits are pursued by the Black Riders all the way to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] on the borders of Buckland. There the Black Riders are forced to ride to the [[Brandywine Bridge]] while the Hobbits make for Bree. The movies remove several parts of the journey as well. These include their encounters with the High Elves, Farmer Maggot, and Tom Bombadil, as well as their visit to Buckland, the Old Forest, and the Barrow-downs.

[[Arwen]], [[Elrond]]'s daughter, leads Frodo to Rivendell instead of Glorfindel. The [[Cave-troll]] inflicts the wound on Frodo in Moria, instead of the orc captain. In the novel, Faramir declared right from the first that he wanted no part of the [[One Ring]], but in the film Faramir at first follows what he believes is his duty to bring the Ring back to [[Minas Tirith]]. But while travelling with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum through the city of [[Osgiliath]], the city is attacked by a [[Nazgûl]] and the forces of [[Mordor]], and Faramir realizes he should not take the Ring after he sees the effect it has on Frodo.
