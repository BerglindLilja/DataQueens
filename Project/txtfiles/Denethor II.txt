'''Denethor II''' was the twenty-sixth and last [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward of Gondor]], and father of the [[War of the Ring]] heroes [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]].

== Biography ==

Denethor was the third child and only son of [[Ecthelion II]].<ref name=heirs/> A proud and noble man, the blood of [[Númenor]] ran truer in him than it had in any man of Gondor for many years. He was described as subtle and often scornful and could perceive the thoughts of men, including those that dwelled far off. It was difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try.

In [[TA 2976]], he married [[Finduilas of Dol Amroth]], daughter of Prince [[Adrahil II]] of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name="anarion">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (iv): "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"</ref> Together, the couple had two sons, [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]]. A few years later, in [[TA 2988]], Finduilas died young, leaving Denethor embittered.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Appendix B: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Third Age"</ref>

He succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in [[TA 2984]]. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in [[Minas Tirith]], and his counsels went unheeded.

=== War of the Ring ===

In later life Denethor secretly used a [[Palantíri|palantír]] to probe [[Sauron]]'s strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the Throne room.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Four: III: "The Palantíri"</ref> The effort aged him quickly, and although Sauron was not able to bend him to his will as he had [[Saruman]], knowledge of the Dark Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife, [[Finduilas of Dol Amroth|Finduilas]], in TA 2988.  

Denethor was well aware that Sauron's assault on Gondor would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In [[TA 3018]] when Sauron [[Sauron's assault on Osgiliath|attacked]] Osgiliath, he found the strength and preparedness of Denethor greater than he had expected or feared. [[Minas Tirith]] was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Denethor sent away from the city the old and the women and children and had the [[Warning beacons of Gondor]] lit, dispatching errand riders to [[Théoden]] to summon aid.  

The death of [[Boromir]], his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Gondor drove Denethor further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of [[Frodo Baggins]] through Ithilien he became estranged from Faramir, though Faramir still upheld his father's wishes.<ref name="anarion" /> Denethor therefore dispatched Faramir with reinforcements to command the garrison at Osgiliath and following the [[Battle of Osgiliath|battle]] there and at the [[Causeway Forts]], sent out a cavalry sortie under the command of Prince [[Imrahil]] to rescue his son's retreat. However Faramir returned severely wounded, breaking Denethor's spirit.

Looking into the palantír, Sauron was able to drive him mad with despair, giving him a hopeless vision of an approaching black fleet from the south, portending that Gondor would fall to Sauron thanks to the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] coming to assist in the [[Siege of Gondor|Siege]]. Sauron, however, obscured the vision's finer details to hide that those ships would in fact be under the command of Gondor's ally [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], who would have ousted the Corsairs at [[Pelargir]] and come by ship to relieve the city. Denethor therefore believed that further resistance was futile, although he remained steadfast in his rejection of the shadow.

He committed suicide on March 15, 3019, having ordered his men to erect a pyre for him and Faramir in the [[Houses of the Dead|Hallows of Minas Tirith]]. He threw a torch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his knee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship and the end of the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the table and so perished, clasping the palantír in his hands. His attempt to take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was thwarted by the timely intervention of [[Beregond (Captain)|Beregond]] and ultimately, by Gandalf.<ref name=pyre/>

Denethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from [[TA 2984]] until his death on [[TA 3019]]. The title of Steward was passed to his son, [[Faramir]], who also became the first of the [[Princes of Ithilien]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter V: "[[The Steward and the King]]"</ref> After his death the Anor stone would only show Denethor's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.

== Etymology ==

''Denethor'' had been the name of the [[Denethor I|Tenth Ruling Steward]] of Gondor, who, in turn, was named after a Nandorin Elf.

The name comes from the Nandorin words ''dene'' ("strong, lithe") and ''thara'' ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. XI: ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', Part Four: [[Quendi and Eldar]], Appendix D: Kwen, Quenya, and the Elvish (especially Ñoldorin) words for 'Language'</ref>

=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy ===
{{Quote|You may triumph on the field of battle for a day, but against the power that has risen in the East, there is no victory.|Denethor, to Gandalf<ref>''[[The Return of the King (film)]]"</ref>}}
In [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|movie trilogy]], Denethor is portrayed by [[John Noble]]. In a significant change from the novels, he is depicted as an incompetent leader driven to insanity by despair. He appears in the extended edition of ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' and is a major character in ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]''.

Denethor appears in one extended flashback scene in ''The Two Towers'', arriving at [[Osgiliath]] as it is liberated by [[Boromir]]'s troops. He congratulates his elder son while disparaging the younger [[Faramir]], and commands Boromir to travel to the [[Council of Elrond]], take the [[One Ring]], and return it to Gondor.[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Denethor.jpg|thumb|Denethor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]In ''The Return of the King'', Denethor is depicted as overcome with despair, convinced that Sauron cannot be opposed. He denies [[Aragorn]]'s birthright to the throne of Gondor, refuses to light the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacons]] to call Rohan for aid and, after Osgiliath is captured by Mordor's forces, sends Faramir and his men on a suicide mission to retake the ruined city. When Faramir is brought back to Minas Tirith unconscious, Denethor hastily concludes that his last son is dead and commands his guards to build a funeral pyre for the both of them, ignoring Pippin's insistence that Faramir is still alive. As Sauron's armies attack [[Minas Tirith]], Denethor prepares to immolate himself alongside Faramir; only Pippin and Gandalf's intervention saves Faramir's life. As he sees Faramir start to awaken, Denethor, now engulfed in flames, throws himself off of the pinnacle of Minas Tirith.

The ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' of Minas Tirith, which causes Denethor's corruption in the novels, is only hinted at in the extended edition of ''The Return of the King''.

===Video games===
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Denethor has two sisters, Terenis and Vanyalos, the wife of Lord [[Forlong]]. His role in the game is relatively minor, as by the time the player reaches [[Minas Tirith]] [[Faramir]] already lies wounded the the Steward's will is failing.
