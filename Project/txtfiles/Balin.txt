'''Balin''' was a [[Dwarf]] leader, the son of [[Fundin]], and elder brother of [[Dwalin]]. He was one of the [[Thorin and Company|thirteen Dwarves]] who accompanied [[Thorin II Oakenshield]] on the quest to regain the [[Lonely Mountain]].

A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble [[Durin's Folk|House of Durin]].

He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]], but within five years it was overcome once more by [[Orcs]], and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Balin was likely born in the [[Lonely Mountain]] before the coming of the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]]. He had a younger brother named [[Dwalin]], and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug [[Sack of Erebor|attacked]] the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in [[Dunland]] as a refugee, before fighting in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] which culminated in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]]. Many years later, in approximately [[TA 2841]], he accompanied [[Thráin II]], the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[Appendix A]], Annals of the Kings and Rulers, III. "Durin's Folk"</ref>

=== Quest for Erebor ===

Balin was part of the [[Thorin and Company|company]] assembled by Thorin Oakenshield in [[TA 2941]] that journeyed to the Lonely Mountain with [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Gandalf]] to defeat Smaug, and to retake the kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at Bilbo's [[Bag End|house]], where, like his brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter I: "[[An Unexpected Party]]"</ref> Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the [[Green Dragon Inn]], Balin spotted Bilbo hurrying to reach them before they set out.<ref name=":0">[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter II: "[[Roast Mutton]]"</ref>
[[File:Balin AUJ.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|240x240px|Balin visits Bilbo in ''[[The Hobbit film trilogy|The Hobbit]]''[[The Hobbit film trilogy| films]]]]
Balin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the [[Trollshaws]] and [[Lone-lands]] to [[Rivendell]], including the encounter with the trolls [[Tom, Bert, and William]].<ref name=":0" /> The company rested in Rivendell for some time, and after setting out to cross the [[Misty Mountains]], were captured by [[Orcs]] on the [[High Pass]], after taking refuge from a thunderstorm.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter IV: "[[Over Hill and Under Hill]]"</ref> With Gandalf's help, the Dwarves escaped, and subsequently Balin was posted as a lookout when Bilbo returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to Bilbo's usage of the [[One Ring]], which he had discovered in the orc tunnels, the Hobbit crept by Balin unnoticed, puzzling the Dwarf a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by [[Wargs]], which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the [[Great Eagles]].<ref name=":1">[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter VI: "[[Out Of The Frying-Pan Into The Fire]]"</ref>

The Eagles took them to their eyrie, and then to the [[Carrock]], from whence the company traveled to the house of [[Beorn]].<ref name=":1" /> Gandalf decided to introduce the Dwarves by pairs so as not to overwhelm Beorn, and Balin and Dwalin were chosen to come first. Having been welcomed by the skin-changer and given rest and provisions, the company set out to cross the forest of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter VII: "[[Queer Lodgings]]"</ref> Despite having been warned to the contrary, the Dwarves eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great [[spiders]], which intended to eat them. Bilbo used the Ring to escape notice, and returned to free them. Balin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the Dwarves were captured by Wood-elves, and taken to the hall of the Elvenking, [[Thranduil]]. It was here that Balin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. Thranduil refused, and imprisoned the dwarves, until Bilbo again rescued the company.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter VIII: "[[Flies and Spiders]]"</ref>

The Dwarves came to [[Lake-town]],<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter X: "[[A Warm Welcome]]"</ref> and then to the Lonely Mountain. After opening the [[Side-door]] to the mountain,<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter XI: "[[On the Doorstep]]"</ref> Balin was the only member of the company willing to go with Bilbo some way inside. The hobbit, after unintentionally disturbing the dragon Smaug, returned to the Dwarves, but Smaug left his lair and attempted to kill the Dwarves before turning to Lake-town, with the intent to destroy it.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter XII: "[[Inside Information]]"</ref> The dragon was there slain by [[Bard]], and the Dwarves took possession of the mountain.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter XIII: "[[Not At Home]]"</ref> Thorin and Balin, not long after, came upon the raven [[Roäc]], who brought word of the dragon's demise.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']]: Chapter XIV: "[[The Gathering of the Clouds]]"</ref>

Balin fought in and survived the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]], which was fought against orcs led by [[Bolg]], after tensions with the [[Lakemen]] and Wood-elves had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of Smaug's treasure.<ref>[[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']], Chapter XVII: "[[The Clouds Burst]]"</ref> He took up residence at the Lonely Mountain afterwards with the surviving members of the company.

=== Visiting Bilbo ===
Seven years after the Quest for Erebor, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in the [[Shire]] in [[TA 2949]], since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and Gandalf gave Bilbo the news of current happenings in Middle-earth.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[Appendix B]], The Tale of Years, "The Third Age"</ref>

=== Expedition and death ===

[[File:Balin's_death.png|thumb|340x340px|Balin at his death bed]]

In [[TA 2989]], Balin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]], hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the [[Seven Rings]] of the Dwarves.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book Two, Ch. I: "[[Many Meetings]]"</ref> While in Moria, he discovered [[Durin's Axe]] and a [[Mithril]] helm. After the discovery of these items Balin took the title [[Lord of Moria]]. Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from [[Thráin II]] by [[Sauron]]. Balin himself, as were the rest of those that followed him, was slain by [[Orcs]], bringing to an end the attempt to retake Moria.<ref name=":2">[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book Two, Ch. V: "[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]"</ref> Ironically he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in [[TA 2799]].

=== Legacy ===
[[File:Durin's grave.jpg|thumb|Balin's tomb at the time of the Fellowship's arrival|190x190px]]Some twenty-five years later in [[TA 3019]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] passed through Moria and discovered [[Balin's tomb]], and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the [[Book of Mazarbul]]. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Balin's cousin [[Gimli]], who was a member of the fellowship.<ref name=":2" />

== Characteristics ==
Balin was a discerning character, being described as the company's "look-out man": He spotted Bilbo approaching the [[Green Dragon Inn]] at [[Bywater]]; he spotted the [[Tom, Bert, and William|trolls]]' fire, and; he was the first to spot the [[Elves]] in [[Mirkwood]]. He noted that not even a mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice Bilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the company after escaping the Orcs in the [[Misty Mountains]]. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the second-eldest dwarf, and loosely held the position of deputy leader.

Balin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who volunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's chamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known to have visited Bilbo at [[Bag End]] after their quest for the Lonely Mountain.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
[[File:Rankin Bass Balin.PNG|thumb|199x199px|Balin (1977)]]

=== Rankin/Bass films ===
In the [[1977]] animated version of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 animated film)|The Hobbit]]'', he was voiced by [[wikipedia:Don Messick|Don Messick]]. 

=== The Hobbit film trilogy ===

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s live-action adaptation, he was portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ken Stott]]. The studio released the following statement regarding Balin in the films:

<blockquote>
''A descendant of nobility and a Dwarf Lord in his own right, Balin is one of the oldest members of The Company of Dwarves. Wise and gentle by nature, he has been forced to live a life fraught with war and the ongoing struggle for survival. Related to Thorin Oakenshield, Balin is one of his closest, most trusted advisers – but deep in his heart, this wisest and most loyal of Dwarves harbors troubling doubts about the wisdom of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain.''</blockquote>

In ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', Balin shows his wisdom when he tells [[Fíli and Kíli]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] about [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]]’s dislike for orcs.

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', Balin persuades [[Bard the Bowman]] to take them safely to Lake-town in return for a huge amount of money (double Bard's usual barge fare), an event that did not occur in the book.

In [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'']], Balin fights in and survives the battle, during which he helps to man a dwarven war chariot and transport [[Dwalin]], [[Fíli]], and [[Kili|Kíli]] to [[Ravenhill]]. He later personally bids Bilbo farewell at his leaving.

==== Personality ====

Balin is portrayed to be the wiser, more social and skeptical individual in Thorin and Company. He is kind, sly and brave, an excellent fighter. Thorin, at one point, quoted on Balin's skill as a fighter. He develops an essentially strong relationship with the other Dwarves he traveled with and was willing to fight alongside them for any cause. He was sympathetic, sometimes cynical, towards Bilbo Baggins, remarking that the latter wasn't fit for the job they had set out to do. He got on brilliantly with Thorin, and seemed to share something of a grandfatherly view of the latter.
