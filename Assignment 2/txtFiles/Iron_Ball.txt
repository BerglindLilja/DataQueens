In {{BotW}}, Iron Balls can be found inside [[Ancient Shrine]]s. They appear rolling down ramps and can damage [[Link]] on contact or by pushing him into the void. Link can stop their movement with [[Stasis]]. By using [[Magnesis]], Link can move the Iron Ball around and use it as protection from incoming [[Boulder]]s.
