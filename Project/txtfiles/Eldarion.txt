'''Eldarion''' ([[Quenya]]: [[IPA charts|IPA]]; "Scion of the Eldar") was the only son and heir of [[Aragorn II Elessar|Elessar]], the [[King of the Reunited Kingdom]], and his [[Half-elven]] wife and queen [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]].

== Biography ==

Eldarion was born in [[FO 1]],<ref name="NOME">''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', I: "Time and Ageing", The Ageing of Elves</ref> and is recorded to have several sisters. He ascended to the throne upon the death of his father in [[FO 120]]. Next to nothing is known of his rule, except that he probably maintained the peace and the borders of the Reunited Kingdom as set down by his father after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (v): "The tale of Aragorn and Arwen"</ref>

== Lineage ==

Through his father, [[Aragorn II Elessar]], he is a direct descendant of Elendil, the grandson of [[Arathorn II]] and [[Gilraen]], great-grandson of [[Arador]] and great-great grandson of [[Argonui]]; both from [[Dúnedain|Dúnedain of the North]].

Through his mother, [[Arwen Undómiel]], he was the grandson of Lord [[Elrond]] and Lady [[Celebrian]], nephew of [[Elladan and Elrohir]] of Rivendell, grandnephew of [[Elros]] Tar-Minyatur, great-grandson of Lady [[Galadriel]] and Lord [[Celeborn]] of [[Lothlorien|Lothlórien]], great grandson of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]].

== Etymology ==

'''''Eldarion '''''is [[Quenya]] for "Son of the Eldar", from ''elda'' ("high-elf) and ''-ion'' (a patronymic ending, "son of, descendant").<ref>''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 338]]</ref>

== Behind the scenes ==

[[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] had vague plans for a sequel to ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy called ''[[The New Shadow]]'', a story set sometime during King Eldarion's reign. However, he abandoned it after about 13 pages. Therefore, it is debatable whether ''The New Shadow'' can be considered canon.
== Trivia ==
*He is portrayed by [[Sadwyn Brophy]], son of [[Jed Brophy]], who portrayed [[Sharku]] and [[Snaga]] in [[The Two Towers (film)|''The Two Towers'' film]] and [[Nori]] in [[The Hobbit (films)|''The Hobbit'' films]].
