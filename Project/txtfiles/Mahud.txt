'''Mahud''' is the name given to the Men of [[Far Harad]] who rode, or "piloted", the [[Mûmakil|Mûmaks]] (Oliphaunts). 

The term was coined by Games Workshop, and as such is non-canonical.

== History ==
The Men of Far Harad were given no specific name by [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]], but Games-Workshop decided to call them "Mahud", perhaps inspired by Indian elephant-tamers called "[[Wikipedia:Mahout|mahout]]". As depicted in [[Peter Jackson]]'s movies, they were the Men who first tamed the Mûmakil, but also they have a population of [[Half-trolls]] with pupil-black skin, blood-red tongues, and snowy-white eyes. The "Mahud" dwelt in jungles that lay in the south of Harad.
