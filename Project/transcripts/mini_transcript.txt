Sam: Here. 
Frodo gardner: What about you? 
Sam: Oh, no. I’m not hungry. Leastways not for lembas bread. 
Frodo: Sam… 
Sam: All right. We don’t have that much left. We have to be careful or we’re going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mister Frodo. I’ve rationed it. There should be enough. 
Frodo: For what? 
Sam: The journey home. 
 
Gollum: Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry! 
 
Merry: It’s good. Definitely from the Shire. Longbottom Leaf.

Pippin: I feel like I’m back at the Green Dragon.
Merry: Green Dragon.
Pippin: A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day’s work.
Merry: Only, you’ve never done a hard day’s work.
