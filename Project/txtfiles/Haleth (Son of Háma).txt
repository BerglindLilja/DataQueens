Haleth is the son of [[Háma]], the door-warden of Meduseld who has died in a [[Warg]] attack. Haleth's only appearance is at Helm's Deep, where he has a grim conversation with [[Aragorn]], telling Aragorn that the men believe that they will not survive the night. Aragorn then reassures him, stating that there is always hope. It is uncertain whether Haleth survived the battle or died defending the fortress alongside many others.  

Haleth is played by [[Calum Gittins]].
