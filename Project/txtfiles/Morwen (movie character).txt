'''Morwen''' was a [[Rohirrim]] woman during the [[War of the Ring]].

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
Morwen was played by [[Robyn Malcolm]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''. Her two young children are [[Freda]] and [[Éothain (film character)|Éothain]], whom she sends away to [[Edoras]] by horse as their village (likely in the [[Westfold]]) is first raided by [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Dunlendings|Wildmen]].

She is seen later in the fortress of the [[Hornburg]][[Helm's Deep|,]] where she is reunited with her children. During the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], she is seen hugging [[Éowyn]] desperately in the refuge of the caves. The fate of her children is unknown.
