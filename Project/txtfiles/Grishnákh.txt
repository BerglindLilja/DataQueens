'''Grishnákh''' was an [[Orc]] captain of [[Mordor]] who led a host of Orcs to join the [[Uruk-hai]] who were taking [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] across [[Rohan]] to [[Isengard]].

==Biography==

Grishnákh's plans for the two captives, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], were in conflict with [[Uglúk]]'s orders to deliver them unharmed. Grishnákh wanted to take them to Mordor, but Uglúk refused his plan, so Grishnákh slipped away while the Orcs and Uruk-hai argued amongst themselves. Grishnákh soon returned with other Orcs like himself.

Grishnákh was somehow aware of the existence of the [[One Ring]] (having been implied to have participated in the torture of [[Gollum]]), and suspected the two Hobbits of possessing it. When the Orcs holding the two Hobbits were attacked by [[Éomer]]'s [[Rohirrim]], Grishnákh used the distraction to search the Hobbits for the Ring. Pippin tried to negotiate with Grishnákh, asking for himself and Merry to be freed in exchange for information about the Ring, but instead Grishnákh tried to carry them away. When it seemed a Rohirrim rider had discovered him, Grishnákh drew his sword to kill the Hobbits lest they be rescued or escape, but before he could act he was shot in the hand by a Rohirrim arrow and dropped the sword, at which point he tried to run but was ridden down and run through with a Rohirrim spear.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers (novel)|The Two Towers]],'' Book Three, Ch. III: "[[The Uruk-hai]]"</ref>

=== The Lord of the Rings (1978 animated film) ===
In [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]], Grishnákh is voiced by a unknown extra.

=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

In ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'', Grishnákh is played by [[Stephen Ure]] and is an Orc captain. He has more screen time in the Extended Edition, which shows Grishnákh and his Orc clan joining Uglúk to escort him and his Uruk-Hai to Isengard. When the Uruk-hai and the Orcs soon begin arguing amongst themselves over lack of food to eat, Grishnákh is vexed by Uglúk's insistence that the captive Hobbits not be killed or maimed. While it is unknown if he knew of Uglúk's mission, Grishnákh attempts to kill the captive Hobbits (probably because of he is hungry and wanting to eat them) before he is hit by a Rohirrim rider's spear. Though he survives to chase Merry and Pippin into [[Fangorn Forest]], When he arrived there he was nearly killing Merry, but being crushed to death by [[Treebeard]] stepping on him.
