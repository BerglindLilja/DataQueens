{{Quote|Things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them.|Treebeard}}

'''Treebeard''', also known as '''Fangorn''', was the oldest of the [[Ents]] left in [[Middle-earth]], an ancient tree-like being who was a "shepherd of trees". He had a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and leafy hair.

In [[The White Rider (chapter)|Chapter 5]] of ''[[The Two Towers]]'', [[Gandalf]] calls Treebeard "...the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth." In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Chapter 6, "[[Many Partings]]", [[Celeborn]] addresses Treebeard as "Eldest."

== History ==

{{Quote|Hrum, now, well, I am an Ent, or that's what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. ''The'' Ent, I am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.|''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers]], Book III, Chapter IV: "Treebeard"''}}

=== Before the Third Age ===

Treebeard was believed to be the oldest Ent who ever lived. He was so old that he remembered the time of Elves teaching the trees to speak, recalling how they wanted to talk to everything. In the time when Middle-earth was merely a giant forest, Treebeard roamed the land, presumably with his love, [[Fimbrethil]]. But after the loss of the [[Entwives]], he and the remaining Ents dwelt in the [[Fangorn Forest|Forest of Fangorn]], isolating themselves from the outside world.

=== Third Age and War of the Ring ===

{{Quote|I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.|''[[The Lord of the Rings]]: Treebeard''}}

[[File:Treebeard_grabs_Pippin.jpg|thumb|220px|Treebeard grabs Pippin.]]

With the arrival of the [[Wizards|Istari]] in the year [[TA 1000]] of the Third Age, [[Saruman]] came to Fangorn and befriended Treebeard, and would often visit him. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Saruman gathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its intertwining paths.<ref name=":0">[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']], Book Three, Ch. IV: "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]"</ref>

As the years passed and with no [[Entings]] due to the loss of the Entwives, the number of Ents fell. Some Ents in their old age became still and silent, almost becoming tree-like as they slumbered. Treebeard, [[Finglas]], [[Fladrif]], [[Quickbeam]] and around fifty remained, some younger, some older. When Sauron's shadow began to spread across the land once more, Treebeard and the Ents remained in Fangorn, continuing to tend the trees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Elves and Wizards. However, they were brought into the war when [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] escaped from Saruman's [[Orcs]], became lost in Fangorn Forest and befriended Treebeard. Upon learning that Saruman was cutting down the forest to power his war effort, an angry Treebeard called all the Ents together for an [[Entmoot]]. After three days of deliberation, they decided to attack [[Isengard]], in an event known as the Last March of the Ents.<ref name=":0" />

Leading the attack, Treebeard helped to bring down Isengard's walls and utterly destroy them, save the tower of [[Orthanc]] and Saruman himself who sat in his tower. The Ents also broke the dam wall which had starved the once green and beautiful [[Nan Curunír|Wizards Vale]] of all its water, flooding Saruman's pits, mines, and machines of war.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']], Book Three, Ch. IX: "[[Flotsam and Jetsam]]"</ref> Once Isengard was cleansed, Treebeard remained to guard Saruman, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of Saruman's voice and the fact that Treebeard could not bear to imprison any living thing.<ref name=":1">[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']], Book Six, Ch. VI: "[[Many Partings]]"</ref>

=== After the War of the Ring and Beyond ===

After [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]] was crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of [[Mordor]] gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.  However, Treebeard lamented that forests may spread once more, but the Ents would not, predicting that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn Forest until they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope for finding the Entwives, as he asked Merry and Pippin to watch for them near the [[Shire]], and to bring word if they were to find them.<ref name=":1" />

Treebeard's ultimate fate is not known. While he aged very slowly and was extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.{{Fact}}He most likely underwent the same fate of all the Ents: eventually settling down in one place, growing roots and leaves, and essentially becoming a tree himself, ceasing conscious thought.

In her final words to Treebeard during their parting at Isengard, [[Galadriel]] said she would "Not [see him] in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of [[Nan-tathren]] we may meet in the spring. Farewell!" This suggests that in the future, perhaps after the [[Dagor Dagorath]], when the lands of [[Beleriand]] will be recovered again, Treebeard and, possibly all the other Ents, will awaken again and that he will meet her again in Nan-Tathren.<ref name=":1" />

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
[[File:Ralph Bakshi Treebeard.PNG|thumb|Treebeard (1978)]]

=== Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings ===
John Westbrook voiced Treebeard in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]].

=== Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===
[[File:Treebeard2.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Treebeard.]]{{Quote|Side? I am on no one's side, because no one is on ''my'' side.|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''}}
In [[Peter Jackson]]'s films ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' ([[2002]]) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' ([[2003]]), Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a [[wikipedia:computer generated imagery|CGI]] construct; his voice is performed by [[John Rhys-Davies]], who also plays [[Gimli]].

In the movie [[The Two Towers (film)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (2002)]], the Ents at the Entmoot initially decline Merry and Pippin's request for help. Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards [[Isengard]], because that is the last place [[Saruman]] would look for them. When Treebeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's Orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents.
{{Quote|Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Ents.|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''}}
They attack Isengard and manage to flood it. In the book, Treebeard and the Ents decide to attack Saruman without any such coercion. They were already most likely aware of this situation.  When [[Gandalf]] arrives at Isengard in [[The Return of the King (film)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (2003)]], Treebeard refers to Gandalf as "young master Gandalf".

=== Video games ===
Treebeard is featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' in both the good and evil campaigns. In the first he appears in the [[Battle of Isengard]] level, where the player must deliver [[Gríma Wormtongue]]'s key to [[Orthanc]] to him. In the second, an alternate timeline in which Frodo took the [[One Ring]] for himself sees Treebeard killed by the [[Balrog]] known as [[Durin's Bane]].

He also appears in [[LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]], in which he is a playable character when one of the Hobbits is riding on his shoulder.
