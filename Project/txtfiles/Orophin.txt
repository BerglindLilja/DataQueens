'''Orophin''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] [[Marchwarden]] from [[Lothlórien]], and the brother of [[Haldir of Lothlórien|Haldir]] and [[Rúmil of Lórien|Rúmil]].
== Biography ==

[[File:FOTR - Lorien Brothers.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Orophin (left) with his brothers Haldir and Rúmil in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]

Orophin guarded the western border of Lothlórien at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. He stood guard with other [[Elves]], including his brothers Haldir and Rumil.<ref name="lorien">''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book Two, Chapter VI: "[[Lothlorien (chapter)|Lothlorien]]"</ref>

Like Rúmil, Orophin knew very little [[Westron]]; therefore, he associated little with the [[Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. When Haldir saw [[Gollum]] rustling through the trees near where the hobbits stayed for the night, Orophin left his brothers to warn the [[Galadhrim]].<ref name="lorien" />

== Etymology ==

Tolkien</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==

In Tolkien's drafts, Orophin's name was spelled ''Orfin'' and ''Orofin''.<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. VII: ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', XII: "Lothlórien"</ref> When Haldir first met the [[Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship]], Orofin was not present to accompany his brother.<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 7: ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', XIV: "Farewell to Lórien"</ref>
