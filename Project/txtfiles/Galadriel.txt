{{Quote|This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.|Galadriel to [[Frodo Baggins]]}}
'''Galadriel''' was the "Lady" of the woods of [[Lothlórien]], which she ruled with [[Celeborn]] her husband.

One of the greatest of the [[Elves]] in [[Middle-earth]], she surpassed nearly all others in beauty, knowledge, and power. She bore [[Nenya]], one of the three Elven rings of power. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] thought of her, along with [[Gil-Galad|Gil-galad]] the Elven-king, as one of the mightiest and fairest of all the [[Elves]] left in Middle-earth in the [[Third Age]].

She was the only daughter and youngest child of [[Finarfin]], prince of the [[Ñoldor]] and of [[Eärwen]], whose cousin was [[Lúthien]]. Her elder brothers were [[Finrod Felagund]], [[Orodreth]], [[Angrod]], and [[Aegnor]].<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Chapter V: "[[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië]]"</ref> Galadriel was a niece of [[Feanor|Fëanor]], the most important Elf of the early [[First Age]].

==History==
===Years of the Trees===
[[File:Dd8x902-9e1f389b-1f40-4a2a-8a57-a082f6b9559e.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Galadriel in Aman, by Filat]]

Galadriel was born in [[Valinor]] in the [[Years of the Trees]], before the [[First Age]]. Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and there are several distinct tales told about her collected in the [[Unfinished Tales]]. According to the older account, used in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the rebellion of the [[Ñoldor]] and their flight from Valinor due to her desire to one day rule over lands in Middle-earth herself.

She was eager to see Middle-earth, having heard of it from [[Fëanor]], and wanted to rule a realm of her own. She swore no oaths and was like minded with her cousin [[Fingon]], son of [[Fingolfin]].<ref name="flight">''The Silmarillion'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter IX: "[[Of the Flight of the Ñoldor]]"</ref>

However, separated from Fëanor and his kin, she and her people did not take part in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]]. They followed Fingolfin instead and crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] in the far north.<ref name="flight" />

===First Age===

Once in [[Beleriand]], she lived nominally with one of her brothers, most likely Finrod, but spent much time at the court of [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]] in [[Menegroth]], where she arrived in [[FA 52]] and was welcomed because of her family relationship to Thingol's brother [[Olwë]], Galadriel's maternal grandfather. She met [[Celeborn]], a kinsman of Thingol, in [[Doriath]].<ref>''The Silmarillion'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XIII: "[[Of the Return of the Ñoldor]]"</ref> She also traveled to visit her brother, [[Finrod]], in his realm of [[Nargothrond]] multiple times. Her three other brothers were killed during various battles in the First Age.

Galadriel became friends with Melian the Maia, who wanted to know the cause of the [[Exile of the Ñoldor]]. Galadriel only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of [[Finwë]], the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at [[Losgar]]. She dwelt in Nargothrond with her brother Finrod, and asked him if he would take no wife. But Finrod had taken an oath only for himself, and his beloved had been left in Valinor.<ref>''The Silmarillion'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XV: "[[Of the Ñoldor in Beleriand]]"</ref>

She had no role in the major wars of the First Age, believing that defeating [[Melkor|Morgoth]] was beyond the power of the [[Eldar]]; when Morgoth was defeated by the coming of the [[Valar]] out of the West she, having played no part in the earlier Kinslaying, was offered safe return to Valinor. However, she chose not to leave Middle-earth, and was the only leader of the Ñoldor exiles to remain after the First Age.<ref>''The Silmarillion'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XXIV: "[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]"</ref>

=== Second Age ===

Celeborn and Galadriel traveled first to [[Lindon]], where they ruled over a group of [[Elves]] as a fiefdom under [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Ñoldor]] Sometime later, they had a daughter, [[Celebrían]]. They moved eastward and established the realm of [[Eregion]], or Hollin, which they ruled under Gil-galad. Eregion, to the west of the [[Misty Mountains]] near [[Khazad-dûm]], was a prosperous kingdom during this time, and had open trade with the [[Dwarves]]. Also, during this time, they made contact with a [[Nandor|Nandorin]] settlement in the valley of the [[Anduin]], later to be known as [[Lothlórien]]. Subsequently, when [[Celebrimbor]] took over the rule of Eregion, Galadriel left by way of the mines of Khazad-dûm. After the death of King [[Amdír]], in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], and the departure his son [[Amroth]], Celeborn and Galadriel became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien.

[[File:Galadriel_recieves_the_Ring.png|thumb|left|260px|Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Cirdan receive the Three Rings of Power.]]

During the [[Second Age]], the Maia [[Sauron|Annatar]], the "Lord of Gifts", guided Celebrimbor and the other Ñoldor of Eregion in the creation of the [[Rings of Power]]. Galadriel took an immediate distrust to Annatar, and it later turned out that this mistrust was justified, as he was eventually revealed to be Sauron. It was she who counseled Celebrimbor in the hiding of the rings, and when Eregion was attacked, Galadriel was entrusted with one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves. Her ring was [[Nenya]], the Ring of Water.

Conscious of Sauron's power, and wishing to thwart it, she did not use the powers of her ring as long as the [[One Ring]] was in Sauron's hands. However, during the [[Third Age]], when the One Ring was lost, she put it to good use protecting the borders of her realm, for the powers of her ring were protection, preservation, and concealment from evil.<ref name="Unfinished">''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Two, Chapter IV: "[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]"</ref>

=== Third Age ===

Through Celebrían's wedding to Elrond, Galadriel was the grandmother of [[Elladan and Elrohir|Elladan, Elrohir]], and [[Arwen]].

The tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries in the Third Age, but after the formation of the [[White Council]] in [[TA 2463]] she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron. During the invasion of the [[Balchoth]], Galadriel provided aid to [[Eorl the Young]] and the [[Éothéod]] in the form of a white mist that protected them both from the evils of Sauron in [[Dol Guldur]] and the sight of their enemies. This allowed the Éothéod to ride unnoticed to the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. They would become the [[Rohirrim]] but regarded her and the Golden Wood with fear.

She played a pivotal role in the formation of the White Council, though her counsel to put [[Gandalf]] at its head was not followed.<ref name="Unfinished" />

==== War of the Ring ====

[[File:Mirror_of_Galadriel.jpg|thumb|260px|Galadriel pours water into the Mirror|alt=]]

During the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel hosted the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] after their escape from the mines of [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]].

Once in [[Caras Galadhon]], Galadriel allowed [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] to peer into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]], enabling them to glimpse possible events of the future. She, in turn, was tested when Frodo later offered to place the One Ring in her keeping. To illustrate what would happen if she accepted, she presented an image of herself corrupted by the ring, declaring:{{Blockquote|In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!}}Then swiftly she returned to her original form, seemingly smaller and frailer than before, declaring, "''I pass the test,''" refusing the Ring and accepting the fate of diminishing (as the time of the Dominion of [[Men]] had come), and returning at last to [[Valinor]]. As the Fellowship departed, she gave each member a [[Elven gifts from Lothlórien|gift]] and an [[Elven]] cloak, and outfitted the party with boats and supplies. [[Gimli]], in particular, was touched by Galadriel's nobility and beauty, and asked for one strand of her golden hair as an heirloom of his house; she generously gave him three (having refused the same request from Fëanor), which he later set in an impregnable crystal.

Apart from the strands of hair given to Gimli, she gave a [[Mallorn]] seed and a small box of earth from her garden to [[Samwise Gamgee]]; a green [[Elfstone]] set in silver to [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], along with a scabbard for his sword; and a belt each to [[Boromir]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. To [[Legolas]] she gave a long, stout bow of the [[Galadhrim]]. To Frodo, she gave a [[Phial of Galadriel|magical phial]] which captured the light of [[Eärendil]]'s star, which Frodo and Sam would later use to great effect to pass through [[Shelob's lair]] to complete their quest. After the departure of the Fellowship, Galadriel acted to ensure the success of the quest. It was she who summoned [[Gwaihir]] to rescue Gandalf off the peak of [[Zirakzigil|Celebdil]], and it was she who nursed him back to health, dressing him in white, symbolizing his status as the new leader of the order. 

Later, she sent word to Aragorn about the [[Paths of the Dead]], and messages to the [[Rangers of the North]], leading to the southward ride of the [[Grey Company]]. As Sauron put forth all his power during the end of the War of the Ring, he was aware of the threat of the Elves and their ancient potency, so he sent armies to besiege many of their settlements in the North while simultaneously assailing the major cities of Men and Dwarves. Lórien itself was [[Battles of Lórien and invasion of eastern Rohan|assaulted three times]] , but the armies of Dol Guldur were driven back due to the courage of the Elves and the power of Galadriel's Ring.

[[File:Elves_head_to_Valinor.png|thumb|right|275px|Galadriel, her husband Celeborn, and Elrond about to leave for Valinor]]

It is said that the power of her Ring could not be overcome unless Sauron himself would come to do battle. After the fall of Sauron she, with [[Thranduil]] of [[Mirkwood]] and their Elven allies, crossed the [[Anduin]] to Dol Guldur, where they tore down its walls and laid bare its pits. She then traveled to [[Minas Tirith]] for the wedding of King Elessar and Lady Arwen and returned to Lórien until [[TA 3021]] when she journeyed to the [[Grey Havens]] and, with the remaining Ring-bearers, took a ship and returned at last to the Undying Lands whence she had come so long ago.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''</ref>

== Character ==
[[File:U54a.jpg|thumb|left|Galadriel shows her mirror to Frodo and Sam]]

The Lady Galadriel - "Lady of Light" - grandmother of Lady Arwen, was an Elven Queen of extraordinary beauty, with her timeless features and golden river of hair.

Galadriel was highly praised for her beauty, particularly that of her hair, which was a deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said by the [[Elves]] of [[Tirion]] to have ensnared the light of the two trees, [[Telperion]] and [[Laurelin]], and possibly to have inspired the creation of the [[Silmarils]] by [[Fëanor]]. She was also the tallest of elf-women, standing at around 6 feet 4 inches, or 193 centimeters. Because of her wisdom and power, she had very important roles throughout the history of Middle-earth, especially during her time in [[Eregion]] and during the [[War of the Ring]]. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white.<br clear="left" />She was known, especially in her younger days, as being quite prideful. However, by the end of the Third Age, that pride had been tempered a great deal by age.
{{blockquote|[...] and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the Noldor; she was strong of body, mind, and will [...] Even among the Eldar she was accounted beautiful, and her hair was held a marvel unmatched. It was golden like the hair of her father and of her foremother Indis, but richer and more radiant, for its gold was touched by some memory of the starlike silver of her mother; and the Eldar said that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, had been snared in her tresses.
|''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', "The History of Galadriel and Celeborn"}}

Regarding her decision to remain in [[Middle-earth]], a passage says:

{{blockquote|After the overthrow of Morgoth at the end of the First Age a ban was set upon her return, and she had replied proudly that she had no wish to do so.
|''The Road Goes Ever On'' <ref group=note>This passage is also mentioned in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', The History of Galadriel and Celeborn</ref>}}

== Powers ==
She was, however, no mere fey being, but a lady of great power. She bore one of the Great Rings - Nenya - the Ring of Adamant, and with the One Ring in her grasp as well, she would be a mighty match for the Dark Lord Sauron.

Galadriel possessed a tremendous amount of magical powers, and was said to be the greatest of the [[Ñoldor]] after [[Fëanor]].

When she still lived in the [[Undying Lands]], she had been a pupil of [[Yavanna]] and [[Aulë]], and she later became a friend of [[Melian]] the [[Maia]]. Hence, it can be deduced that she had learned her powers from these three illustrious personages, though the nature of her magic is still not well-understood.

The majority of Galadriel's powers were said to stem from the legendary artifact she controlled: [[Nenya]], the Ring of Water. In some tales, she was also depicted with the powers of communicating over vast distances, predicting the future, and even cloaking her mind from other tremendously powerful beings (she once stated that Sauron could not perceive her mind, though she could perceive his). It is also possible that her powers of divination were either derived from or accentuated by her [[The Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]], which could reveal events of the past, present, and future.

However, due to her incredibly enigmatic nature, even the immensely skillful [[Saruman]] and an Elf as perceptive as Elrond found it difficult to understand her powers, and they were such to bring doubt to the minds of the non-Elven inhabitants of Middle-earth. Whatever they might have been, it must still be noted that Galadriel had used them for good: protecting Lórien from any attack. She also used this formidable power to destroy the very foundations of [[Dol Guldur]] (a fortress whose power was multiplied by Sauron's magic). Galadriel also possessed the skill of ''ósanwe'' (the ability to communicate with others through thoughts), this can be seen after the destruction of the [[One Ring]], when Galadriel communicated mentally with [[Elrond]] and [[Gandalf]] on their return journey from Minas Tirith.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter VI: "[[Many Partings]]"</ref>

Besides her magical powers, Galadriel was also very wise and intelligent: she was one of the very few who were not fooled by Sauron in the Second Age, and therefore suggested to [[Celebrimbor]] to hide the [[Three Rings]]. She also refrained from using the powers of Nenya while the One Ring was in Sauron's possession, and only did so after the One Ring was lost (for it was only then that it was safe enough for her to do so). When Frodo offered her the One Ring, Galadriel managed to reject the undeniable temptation, for she was wise enough to know that, though she might start off with good intentions with the One Ring in her possession, she would only become a tyrant as terrible as Sauron in the end. This could be viewed as a testament to her excellent understanding of the seductive nature of power, as well as her awareness of her own personal limitations. 

== Etymology ==
''Galadriel ''was originally named '''Artanis '''("noble woman") which was her Father-name and '''Nerwen''' ("man-maiden"), which was her Mother-name (referring to her height and strength). ''Galadriel'' is the [[Sindarin|Sindarinized]] version of [[Teleri|Telerin]] [[Quenya]] '''Alatáriel''', the name given to her by her lover [[Celeborn]], meaning "maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance", which referred to her hair.

The name '''Galadhriel''' was used outside Lórien by the people who did not know the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing her name with the [[Sindarin|Elvish]] word ''galadh'' ("tree") and the name of the [[Wood-elves|Galadhrim]], the people of Lórien.

=== Names and titles ===
She is referred to as '''The Lady of Lórien''', '''Lady of Light''', '''The Lady of the Galadhrim''', or '''The Lady of the Wood''' interchangeably. Within the realm of [[Lothlórien]], she was referred to as simply '''Lady Galadriel''' or '''The Lady'''.

When she and Celeborn were being referred to collectively, they were known as '''The Lord and Lady'''.

[[Faramir]] of [[Gondor]] referred to her as a '''Mistress of Magic''' when [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] were with him in [[Henneth Annûn]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Book Four, Ch. V: "[[The Window on the West]]", pg. 667 (50th Anniversary One-Volume Edition)</ref>

=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy  ===
{{Quote|Even [[Hobbits|the smallest person]] can change the course of the future.|Galadriel to [[Frodo Baggins]]}}

Galadriel is portrayed by [[Cate Blanchett]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film [[Lord of the Rings film trilogy|trilogy]]. She appears in all three films as a supporting character. 
[[File:LadyGaladriel.jpg|thumb|273x273px|The Lady Galadriel as portrayed by Cate Blanchett]]
Galadriel narrates the opening prologue to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', describing the [[War of the Ring]] and the initial defeat of [[Sauron]]. She is shown receiving one of the [[Rings of Power#The Three|elven Rings of Power]]. Galadriel appears in person later when [[Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]] arrive in [[Lórien]], greeting them alongside her husband [[Celeborn]]. She speaks telepathically with [[Frodo]] and leads him to [[The Mirror of Galadriel|her mirror]], in which he sees a vision of Sauron's victory. Galadriel warns Frodo that [[Boromir]] will try and take the One Ring, upon which Frodo offers The Ring to her. In that moment, Galadriel herself is tempted by the Ring, but she is able to overcome the temptation and "pass the test." She gives Frodo [[Phial of Galadriel|a phial of light]] when the Fellowship departs Lothlórien.

In the extended edition, Galadriel and [[Celeborn]] give the other members of the Fellowship various gifts as well. Besides [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]], she gave [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] an Elven dagger, [[Aragorn]] a curved [[Elvish]] hunting knife, [[Legolas]] a [[Bow of the Galadhrim]] and three strands of [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] hair was given to [[Gimli]].

In ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'', Galadriel appears in a single scene, warning [[Elrond]] telepathically that the One Ring is tempting [[Faramir]]. She then urges him to send aid to the people of [[Rohan]] at [[Helm's Deep]]. Strangely, the elves that do arrive at Helm's Deep under [[Haldir]] are from Lothlórien, not Rivendell. Although there is mention of ''osanwe'' ("thought speech") in Tolkien's writings, Galadriel's scenes from ''The Two Towers'' have no direct counterparts in the novels.

In ''[[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]]'', Galadriel appears in a vision to Frodo near [[Cirith Ungol]], urging him to continue his quest. She also appears at the very end of the film alongside Elrond and Celeborn at the [[Grey Havens]]. She departs with them, Gandalf, Frodo, and Bilbo to Valinor.

=== The Hobbit film trilogy ===
[[File:Galadriel_in_The_Hobbit_AUJ.jpg|thumb|260px|Galadriel in ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'']]

Galadriel's role in Jackson's [[The Hobbit (films)|''The Hobbit'' film trilogy]] is entirely invented for the adaptation, as she does not appear in [[The Hobbit|the original novel]]. She appears in all three films as a supporting character.

Galadriel first appears in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' at a meeting of the White Council alongside [[Elrond]], [[Gandalf]], and [[Saruman]]. She believes Gandalf when he claims that the Necromancer is becoming a bigger threat and that something must be done with [[Dol Guldur]].

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'', Galadriel telepathically encourages Gandalf to investigate the tombs of [[Nazgûl|the Nine]] in the High Fells and to confront the Necromancer.

[[File:BotFATrailer30.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Galadriel aiding a wounded Gandalf in Dol Guldur, surrounded by The Nine]]

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', Galadriel rescues Gandalf from Dol Guldur. Initially, it seems that she has come alone; she defeats an orc with a blast of magic from Nenya. However, she is quickly cornered by the spectral forms of the ''[[Nazgûl]]'' as the disembodied voice of Sauron begins taunting her in the Black Speech. The Dark Lord mocks the Elf Queen for being alone in the shadow, a singular light in the dark.

However, Galadriel reveals that Saruman and Elrond have accompanied her to Dol Guldur, and the two battle the Ringwraiths while Galadriel attempts to heal Gandalf with a kiss, an action which drains her energy. [[Radagast]] arrives to take Gandalf away, and Galadriel resists Gandalf's plea to have her join him. After the Ringwraiths are defeated, Sauron himself manifests and restores the [[Nazgûl]] as he bears down on the [[White Council]], threatening them with the fall of the West and the rise of [[Angmar]]. While Saruman and Elrond recoil in horror in the presence of the Dark Lord, Galadriel rises in her darker ethereal form to challenge Sauron with the [[Light of Eärendil]].

She easily overpowers the [[Nazgûl]] and casts them away as her and Sauron engage in a duel of wills with the latter trying to assert his power. Galadriel, however, proves herself unyielding and declares Sauron as "Nameless, Faceless, and Formless" and demands that he returns to the Void form whence he came. Ultimately Galadriel overpowers Sauron, who is flung into the East as an orb of fire. The encounter saps Galadriel's energy, however, and Saruman instructs her to retreat to [[Lórien]] while he promises to handle the threat of Sauron himself.

=== Radio series ===
Galadriel was voiced by [[Marian Diamond]] in [[BBC]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' 1981 radio series]].

=== Video games ===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Galadriel.jpg|thumb|Galadriel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', Galadriel appears as one of the ring heroes, making her one of the two most powerful units in the game. She has the appearance of her corrupted image in Jackson´s films. She fights using magic which can swipe dozens of units in a single hit. Her power was to summon a tornado as the one she used to destroy Dol Guldur. (''See [http://bfme.wikia.com/Galadriel Galadriel] at [http://bfme,wikia.com The Wiki for Middle-earth]'')

*Introduced in ''The Mines of Moria'' expansion, Galadriel plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''. She gives guidance to the player by showing them a personalized vision on her Mirror, assists the Dwarves of the Iron Garrison who attempt to reclaim [[Moria]] and authorizes an assault on [[Dol Guldur]] to distract the Enemy's eye from the Fellowship leaving [[Lothlorien|Lothlórien]]. She sends the message to [[Elrond]] urging him to assemble the [[Grey Company]] and lead them south to [[Aragorn]]'s aid; when the player returns to Lothlórien in the company of a girl from [[Dunland]], Galadriel sends them and another Lorien elf to follow the path of the Fellowship along the Great River and discover what had happened on [[Amon Hen]]. During the final days of the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel assembles the Council of Elven Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against [[Dol Guldur]] even though it would hasten the declice of their race in [[Middle-earth]], such as her Mirror's power being spend forevermore. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Galadriel meets Arwen on her journey south to her wedding and they visit the site of [[Celebrian]]'s captivity in the [[Misty Mountains]] together. Afterwards, she and Lord Celeborn join the procession of [[Elrond]]'s house and travel to [[Minas Tirith]] to attend the wedding of Arwen and Aragorn.

== In popular culture ==

The name ''Galadriel'' has moved outside of Tolkien's work and into the wider world. Parents occasionally give it to their daughters. The [[wikipedia:Led Zeppelin|Led Zeppelin]] songs'' [[wikipedia:Stairway to Heaven|Stairway to Heaven]]'' and ''[[The Battle of Evermore]]'' contain many references to Galadriel. The band [[wikipedia:Barclay James Harvest|Barclay James Harvest]] also wrote a song named "''Galadriel''." Galadriel was the given name of the main [[wikipedia:Galadriel Hopkins|character]] in the [[wikipedia:Katherine Paterson|Katherine Paterson]] novel ''[[wikipedia:The Great Gilly Hopkins|The Great Gilly Hopkins]]''. In the novel Panic, there are a group of computer hackers known simply as Galadriel Jones and the elves. Since ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V%3A_Skyrim Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]'' was released, the Elven names of Galadriel and [[Legolas]], and [[Elrond]] were often used by fans to name their characters.
