      "The restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a subplot of ''The Lord of the Rings''; Aragorn's adventures not only aid Frodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which, though his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to historical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have been under the rule of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] for centuries, as it was widely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. After the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], [[Meneldil]], son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from Arnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with the northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This arrangement had been reinforced by the Steward [[Pelendur]] after nearly 2,000 years when he rejected [[Arvedui]]'s claim to the Throne of Gondor during a succession crisis ([[Eärnil I|Eärnil]], a member of the [[House of Anárion]], was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting, however, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had married a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a descendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Concept and creation ===\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Identity ====\n",
      "The \"first term\" of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or Strider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of Frodo Baggins) at the [[inn]] of [[The Prancing Pony]]. His description and behavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the difference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter for the \"clitter-clap\" sound that they produced. He was also accounted to be \"one of the wild folk — rangers\", and he played the same role in Frodo's journey to Rivendell as in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of \"Trotter\" for a long time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits as originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either a Man or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was \"very well known\" (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of Bingo: \"I keep on feeling that I have seen him somewhere before\". Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo Baggins himself, but rejected that idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another suggestion was that Trotter was \"Fosco Took (Bilbo's first cousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf\". This story was further elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin Boffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after he came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped Gandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why Trotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in Mordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien in the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had wooden feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the following recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make Trotter \"a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell\", and a scout from Rivendell who \"pretends to be a ranger\".<ref>''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol. 7: ''The Treason of Isengard'', I: \"Gandalf's Delay\"</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter, from the beginning introducing him as a \"descendant of the ancient men of the North, and one of Elrond's household\", as well as the name Aragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of [[Elros]] and Elendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and would come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character of Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second and Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Further character developments ====\n",
      "The development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex, as was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's forefathers were the exiles of [[Númenor]] who ruled over the people of Ond (the early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King \"when Sauron raised a rebellion\". The story of the two branches of Elendil's descendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations only emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have conceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant feature which was not established until late stages was Aragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn, the interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with suggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story. Another proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge Théoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in reference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the full tale of Aragorn and Arwen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he would accordingly be titled the \"Lord of the Ring\".\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Rejected names ====\n",
      "The original nickname '''Trotter''' was retained for a long while, and Tolkien decided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed. There were also several experimental translations of Trotter to Sindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly being equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title \"the Dúnadan\", Quenya Tarkil (\"Noble Man\") was first used, synonym with Númenórean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's \"real\" name. Although Aragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an Elvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via Elfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing \"west\". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: Galadriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to Elfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of Elessar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered Elfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with various Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name of Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien intended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling upon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim with [[Ingold]].<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 7: ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', XIV: \"Farewell to Lórien\"</ref>\n",

This actually conforms to a statement appearing in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that implicitly says that Aragorn was not supposed to have one, due to his Elvish ancestry (Elves did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or later, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of Middle-earth, there is a discussion of the Elvish strain in Men, as to its being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended (it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless. However, Tolkien actually wrote elsewhere that Elves ''did'' have beards; in ''The Lord of the Rings'' itself [[Círdan]] is described as having a beard.
