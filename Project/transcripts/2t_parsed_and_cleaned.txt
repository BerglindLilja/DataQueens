Gandalf: You cannot pass! 
Frodo: Gandalf! 
Gandalf: I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you! Flame of Udun! 


Gandalf: Go back to the shadow! YOU… SHALL NOT... PASS!!! 

 

BOROMIR:  No! Frodo! 
Gandalf: Fly you fools! 

 

Frodo: Nooooooooo! 
 

Frodo: Gandalf! 
Sam: What is it Mr. Frodo? 
Frodo: Nothing. Just a dream. 
 



Sam: Mordor. The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer. It's the one place we are trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it Mr. Frodo. We're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. 
Frodo: He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam. But they did. 



Sam: Frodo? It's the Ring isn't it? 
Frodo: It's getting heavier. What food have we got left? 
Sam: Well, let me see. Oh yes, lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread. I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad. 
Frodo: Nothing ever dampens your spirits does it Sam? 
Sam: Those rainclouds might. 

 

Sam: This looks strangely familiar. 
Frodo:  That's because we've been here before! We are going in circles! 
Sam: Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it? 
Frodo: Yes I can smell it. We are not alone. 
Gollum:  Those thieves! Those filthy little thieves! Wheeere isssit? Wheeere isssit? They stole it from us. My preciousssss. 



Frodo: This is Sting. You've seen it before, haven't you, Gollum! Release him or I'll cut your throat! 

 

Gollum: It burns! It burns us! Take it off! 
Sam: Quiet you! It's hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket! Let's tie him up and leave him! 
Gollum: No! Thats will kill us, kill us! 
Sam: It's nothing more than you deserve! 
Frodo: Maybe he does deserve to die. Now that I've seen him, I do pity him. 
Gollum:  We be nice to them, if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears! 
Frodo: There is no promise you can make that I can trust. 
Gollum: We swears to serve the master of the precioussss. We swears on, on the precioussss! Gollum Gollum 
Frodo: The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word. 
Gollum: Yes... on the preciouss... on the preciousss. 
Sam: I don't believe you! Get down! Get down! 



Frodo: : Sam! 
Sam: He was trying to trick us! We let him go, he'll throttle us into our sleep! 
Frodo:  You know the way to Mordor? 
Gollum:  Yes. 
Frodo: You've been there before? 
Gollum:  Yes. 
Frodo: : You will lead us to the Black Gate. 


 

Pippin: Merry! Merry! 

 
 

Uglúk: What is it? What do you smell? 
Maúhur: Man-flesh. 
Pippin:  Aragorn! 
Uglúk: They've picked up our trail! Let's go! 

 


Aragorn: Their pace quickens. They must have caught our scent. Hurry! 
Legolas: Come on Gimli! 
Gimli: Three day's and night's pursuit.. no food... no rest... and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. 



Aragorn: Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall. 
Legolas: They may yet be alive. 
Aragorn: Less than a day ahead of us, come! 
Legolas: Come Gimli! We are gaining on them. 
Gimli: I'm wasted on cross-country. We dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous we are over short distances. 

 

Aragorn: Rohan, home of the horse-lords. There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures. Sets its will against us. Legolas! What does your elf eyes see? 
Legolas: The Uruks turn Northeast. They are taking the hobbits to Isengard! 
Aragorn: Saruman. 

 

Saruman: The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers? Together, Lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-Earth. 

 

Saruman:  
The old world will burn in the fires of industry. Forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs. We now have only to remove those who oppose us. 

 

Saruman: The horsemen have taken your lands. They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of rocks. 
CROWD: Murderers! 
Saruman: Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village! 
... It will begin in the Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more. 

 

Mother: Eothain, take your sister. You'll go faster with just two. 
Freya: But Papa says Eothain must not ride. He's too big for him! 
Mother: Listen to me! You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me? 
Eothain: Yes mum. 
Freya: I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go! 
Mother: Listen to me. I will find you there. 

 
Mother:Quickly! Go, child!  Oh, child. 

 

Saruman:  Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. 

 

Èowyn: Théodred! 

 
 

Èowyn:  Your son is badly wounded, my lord. 
Èomer: He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. 
Grima: That is a lie! Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally. 
Théoden:  Grima... Grima 
Èomer: Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. 

 
Grima: Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see? Your uncle is weary of your malcontent, your warmongering. 
Èomer: Warmongering? How long has it been since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure? 

 

Eomer: Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps. 
Grima: You see much, Èomer son of Èomund. Too much. You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan, under pain of death. 

 

Gimli: Keep breathing, that's the key! Breathe! Ho! 
Legolas: They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. 
 

BAGLOR: We ain't goin' no further till we've 'ad a breather. 
Uglúk: Get the fire going! 
Pippin: Merry! Merry! 
Merry: I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin. 

 

Pippin: What's making that noise? 
Merry: It's the trees. 
Pippin: What? 
Merry: You remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall, and come alive. 
Pippin: Alive? 
Merry: Trees that could whisper, talk to each other, even move. 
BAGLOR: I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days! 
Roc: Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?  What about them? They're fresh! 
Uglúk: They are not for eating! 
Grishnákh: What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh! They look tasty! 
Uglúk: Get back! 
Roc: Just a mouthful? 

 

Uglúk: Looks like meat's back on the menu boys! 

 

Merry: Pippin, let's go! 

 

Grishnákh: Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one's gonna save you now! 

 

Merry: Pippin! 

 

Pippin: Ahh! 

 

Legolas: A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night. 

 

Aragorn: Riders of Rohan! What news from the Mark? 

 

Èomer: What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! 
Gimli: Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine. 
Èomer:  I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground. 

 

Legolas: You would die before your stroke fell! 

 
Aragorn: I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas, from the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, its King. 
Èomer: Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.  Not even his own kin. 

 

Èomer: Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this land. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets. 
Aragorn: We are not spies. We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains. They have taken two of our friends captive. 
Èomer: The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. 
Gimli: : But there were two Hobbits, do you see two Hobbits with them? 
Aragorn: They would be small, only children to your eyes. 
Èomer: We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. 

 

Gimli: : They are dead? 
Èomer:  May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters. Farewell. Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands. 
 We ride north! 

 

Gimli:  It’s one of their wee belts. 
Legolas:  
Aragorn: AAAHHH!!!  
Gimli:  We failed them. 

 

Aragorn: A Hobbit lay here, and the other. 

 

Aragorn: They crawled. 

 

Aragorn: Their hands were bound. 

 

Aragorn: Their bonds were cut. They ran over here and were followed. 

 

Merry: The belt! Run! 

 

Aragorn: Tracks lead away from the battle, into... Fangorn Forest. 
Gimli: Fangorn! What madness drew them there? 

 

Pippin: Did we lose him? I think we lost him. 

 

Grishnákh: I'm gonna rip off both your little heads! Come here! 
Merry: Trees! Climb a tree! 

 

Merry: He's gone. 

 

Pippin: Merry! 

 

Pippin: Ah! 

 
Grishnákh: Let’s put a maggot-hole in your belly. 

 

Pippin: Run, Merry! 

 

Treebeard: Little Orcs! 
Pippin: It's talking Merry. The tree is talking. 
Treebeard: Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent. 
Merry: Treeherder! Shepherd of the forest. 
Pippin: Don't talk to it Merry. Don't encourage it. 
Treebeard: Treebeard some call me. 
Pippin: And whose side are you on? 
Treebeard: Side? I am on nobody's side. Because nobody is on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore. 
Merry: We are not Orcs. We are Hobbits! 
Treebeard: Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me. They come with fire, they come with axes. Biting, breaking, hacking, burning. Destroyers and usurpers. Curse them! 
Merry: No! You don't understand. We are Hobbits, halflings. Shirefolk! 
Treebeard: Maybe you are, and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know. 
Pippin: White Wizard? 
Merry: Saruman! 

 
 

Gollum: See, see, we have led you out! Hurry, hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice hobbit. 
Sam: Whoa! It's a bog! He's led us into a swamp! 
Gollum: Swamp, yes. Come master. We will take you to safe paths, through the mist. Come Hobbits, come. We move quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quickly. 
Sam: There are dead things! Dead faces in the water! 
Gollum: All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and Orcs. A great battle long ago. The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes! That is the name. This way. Don't follow the lights. 
Sam: Ohh! 
Gollum: Careful now! Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones, and light little candles of their own. 

 

Sam: Frodo! 

 

Frodo: Gollum? 
Gollum: Don't follow the lights! 
Sam: Frodo! are you alright? 

 

Gollum: So bright, so beautiful. Ah precious. 
Frodo: What did you say? 
Gollum: Master should be resting. Master need to keep up his strength. 
Frodo: Who are you? 
Gollum: Mustn't ask us it's name, not his business. Gollum, gollum. 
Frodo: Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk. 
Gollum: Cold be heart and rock and bone. And call every traveller far from home. 
Frodo: He said your life was was a sad story. 
Gollum: They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead. 
Frodo: You were not so different from a Hobbit once were you... Sméagol? 
Gollum: What did you call me? 
Frodo: That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago. 
Gollum: My... My name... Sméagol. 

 

Sam: Black Riders! 
Gollum: Hide! Hide! 

 

Sam: C'mon Frodo, C'mon! 
Gollum: They will see us! They will see us. Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! 
Sam: I thought they were dead! 
Gollum: Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. 
Ringwraith:  
Gollum: They are calling for the precious. They are calling for the preciousssss. 

 

Sam: It's alright. 

 

Gollum: Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close. 
 

Gimli: Orc blood! 
Aragorn: These are strange tracks. 
Gimli: The air is so close here. 
Legolas:This forest is old. Very old. Full of memories...and anger. The trees are speaking to each other. 
Aragorn: Gimli! 
Gimli: Huh? 
Aragorn: Lower your axe. 
Gimli: Oh! 
Legolas: Aragorn, nad no ennas!  
Aragorn: Man cenich?  
Legolas: The White Wizard approaches. 
Aragorn: Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us! We must be quick. 

 

Wizard: You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits 
Aragorn: Where are they? 
Wizard: They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you? 
Aragorn: Who are you? Show yourself! 

 

Aragorn: It cannot be! You fell! 
Gandalf: Through fire and water. 

 

Gandalf:  From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth. 

 

Gandalf:  Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead and each day was as long as a life age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back until my task is done. 



Aragorn: Gandalf. 
Gandalf: Gandalf? Oh yes. That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. 
Gimli: Gandalf! 
Gandalf: I am Gandalf the White now. And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide. 

 

Gandalf: One stage of the journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed. 

 

Legolas: That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. 
Gandalf: Shadowfax. He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers. 

 

 
Treebeard: My home. I sleep in the forest here. The roots of the mountains. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I'll keep you. The trees have gone wild and dangerous. Anger is in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us that are left to manage them. 

 
Gollum: The Black Gate of Mordor. 
Sam: My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this. 
Gollum: Master says show him the way into Mordor so good Sméagol does what master says so. 
Frodo: I did. 

 

Sam: We cannot get past them. 

 

Sam: Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down. 

 

Frodo: Sam! No! 
Sam: Ah!! 

 

Gollum: Master! 

 

Frodo: I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. 
Sam: I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there. 
Frodo: Now! 
Gollum: No! No! No master! They catch you! They catch you. Don't take it to Him. He wants the precioussss. Always he's looking for it. And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him, but we musn't let him have it. 



Gollum: No! There is another way. More secret, and dark way. 
Sam: Why haven't you spoke of this before?! 
Gollum: Because master did not ask! 
Sam: He is up to something. 
Frodo: Are you saying that there is another way to Mordor? 
Gollum: Yes. There is a path, and some stairs and then a tunnel. 
Frodo: He has led us this far, Sam. 
Sam: Mr. Frodo, no! 
Frodo: He's been true to his word. 
Sam: No! 
Frodo: Lead the way, Sméagol. 
Gollum: Good Sméagol always help. 

 

Gandalf: Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown and Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong. 

 

Èowyn: My lord, your son is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing? 

 

Gandalf: Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here. 

 

Grima: Ohh he, he must have died ss-sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir. I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you. 

 

Èowyn: Leave me alone, you snake! 
Grima:  
Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness, the bitter watches of the night. When all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. 

 

Grima: So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill. 
Èowyn:  Your words are poison! 

 
 

Gimli: You'll find more cheer in a graveyard. 

 

Gandalf: Ah. 
Hama: I cannot allow you before Théoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame... By order of - Grima Wormtongue. 

 

Hama:  Your staff. 
Gandalf: Hmm?  Oh. No, you would not part an old man from his - walking stick. 

 
 

Grima: My Lord. Gandalf the Grey is coming. A herald of woe. 
Gandalf: The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden-King. 
Grima: He is not welcome. 
Théoden: Why should I welcome you, Gandalf - Stormcrow? 
Grima: : A just question, my liege. 
 
 Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. 
Gandalf: Silence! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! 

 

Grima: Your staff...  I told you to take the wizard's staff! 

[The guards rush out from the sides, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli take them on without difficulty. Grima hurries off to the side, and Gandalf approaches the King. 

Gandalf: Théoden, Son of Thengel. Too long have you sat in shadows. 

 

Gimli: I would stay still if I were you! 
Gandalf: Hearken to me! I will release you from the spell. 
Théoden: Hahahahahahahaha! You have no powers here Gandalf the Grey. Haha! Ah!! 
Gandalf: I shall draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. 

 

Aragorn: Wait. 
Théoden:  If I go, Théoden dies. 
Gandalf: You did not kill me, you will not kill him. 
Théoden:  Rohan is mine! 
Gandalf: Be gone!  

 

Théoden: I know your face. 

 

Théoden: Èowyn... Èowyn. 

 
 

Théoden: Gandalf? 
Gandalf: Breathe the free air again, my friend. 
Théoden: Dark my dreams have been of late. 
Gandalf: Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword. 

 

Grima: Ah! I've only ever served you my lord 
Théoden: Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! 
Grima: Send me not from your side! 

 

Aragorn: No my lord! Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account. 
Grima: Get out of my way! 
Aragorn: Hail, Théoden, King! 
Théoden: Where is Théodred? Where is my son? 

 

Théoden: Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days shall be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house. 
Gandalf: Théodred's death was not of your making. 
Théoden: No parent should have to bury their child. 
Gandalf: He was strong in life. His spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers. 

 

 

Èowyn: They were unarmed. They had no warning. Now the wildmen are moving through westfold, burning as they go, every rick and cot. 
Freya 
Where's momma? 
Èowyn: Shh. 
Gandalf: This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from the women and children. You must fight. 
Aragorn: You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Èomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. 
Théoden: They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. Èomer cannot help us. I know what is that you want of me. But I would not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. 
Aragorn: Open war is upon you, whether would you risk it or not. 
Théoden: When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. 
Gandalf: Then what is the king's decision? 

 
Hama: By order of the king, The city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. 
Gandalf: Helm's Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king? 
Aragorn: He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past. 
Gandalf: There is no way out of that of ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he is leading them to safety but what he'll get is a massacre. Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end there, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses have to hold. 
Aragorn: They will hold. 
Gandalf: Good luck. My search will not be in vain. Look to my coming. At first light of the fifth day at dawn, look to the East. 
Aragorn: Go. 

 
 

Aragorn: You have some skill with a blade. 
Èowyn: Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain. 
Aragorn: What do you fear my lady? 
Èowyn: A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. 
Aragorn: You are a daughter of kings. A shieldmaiden of Rohan. I do not think that will be your fate. 

 

Grima: Théoden will not stay at Edoras. It is vulnerable. He knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. It will be slow. They will have women and children with them. 

 

Saruman: Send out your warg riders. 

 
Sam: Hey Stinker! Don't go getting too far ahead! 
Frodo: Why do you do that? 
Sam: What? 
Frodo: Call him names? Run him down all the time. 
Sam: Because. 'Cause that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about. 
Frodo: You have no idea what it did to him. What is still doing to him. I want to help him Sam. 
Sam: Why? 
Frodo: Because I have to believe he could come back. 
Sam: You can't save him, Mr. Frodo. 
Frodo:  I'm sorry Sam. I don't know why I said that. 
Sam: I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taking a hold of you Mr Frodo. You have to fight it! 
Frodo:  It's my task! Mine! My own! 
Sam: Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like? 

 

Gollum:We wants it, we needs it. Must have the Preciousss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, falssse! 
Sméagol: No! No! Master! 
Gollum: Yess. Preciousss first. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie! 
Sméagol: Master's my friend. 
Gollum: You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you. 
Sméagol: Not listening. Not listening. 
Gollum: You´re a liar, and a thief. 
Sméagol: No. 
Gollum: Murderer! 
Sméagol: Go away. 
Gollum: Go away?! Ahahhaa! 
Sméagol: I hate you, I hate you. 
Gollum: Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me. 
Sméagol: Not anymore. 
Gollum: What did you say? 
Sméagol: Master looks after us now. We don't need you. 
Gollum: What? 
Sméagol: Leave now and never come back. 
Gollum: No! 
Sméagol: Leave now and never come back! 
Gollum: Ahh! 
Sméagol: LEAVE NOW AND NEVER COME BACK! 

 

Sméagol: We told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. Gone, gone, gone, Sméagol is free! 

 

Sméagol: Look! Look! See what Sméagol finds! Ehehe! Hohohhooo! They are young! They are tender and nice. Yes they are! Eat them. Eat them. 
Sam: Make him sick you will, behaving like that. There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys. 

 

Sméagol: Argh!! What's he doing! Stupid fat hobbit. You ruins it! 
Sam: What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them. What we need it a few good taters. 
Sméagol: What's taters? Preciousss, what's taters? Huh? 
Sam: Po-ta-toes!! Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. 
Sméagol: Phooh! 
Sam: Even you couldn't say no to that. 
Sméagol: Oh yes we could. Ssspoiling nice fish! Give it to ussss raw. and wwwriggling. You keep nasty chips! 
Sam: You're hopeless. 

 

Sam: Mr Frodo? 

 

Sam: Who are they? 
Sméagol: Wicked men, servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready. 
Sam: Ready to do what? 
Sméagol: To make His war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow. 
Frodo: We've got to keep moving. C'mon Sam. 
Sam: Mr. Frodo! Look! It's an Oliphant! No one at home will believe this. 

 

Frodo: Sméagol? 

 

Frodo: We've lingered here for too long. C'mon Sam! 

 

Sam: Ah! 
Faramir: Bind their hands. 
 

Gimli: It's true you don't see many dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, they are often mistaken for dwarf men. 
Aragorn: It's the beards. 
Gimli: And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women. And the dwarves just, spring out of holes in the ground! Which is of course ridiculous. Whoa! 

 

Gimli: It's alright! It's alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate. 

 

Arwen: The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane. It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart. Go to sleep. 
Aragorn: I am alseep. This is a dream. 
Arwen: Then it is a good dream. Sleep. 
Aragorn: Sleep... Minlû pedich nin, i aur hen telitha.  
Arwen: Ú i vethed...nâ i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bâd lîn. 
 
Aragorn: Dolen i vâd o nin.  
Arwen: Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe ú-dhannathach. 
 
Aragorn: Arwen. 
Arwen: Ae ú-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. 
 

 

Èowyn: Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel? 

 
Elrond: Our time here is ending. Arwen's time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the West. Let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands, there to be ever green. 
Aragorn: But never more than a memory. 
Elrond: I will not leave my daughter here to die. 
Aragorn: She stays because she still has hope. 
Elrond: She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people. 

 

Aragorn: Edra le men, men na guil edwen... haer o auth a nîr a naeth.  
Arwen: Why are you saying this? 
Aragorn: I'm mortal. You are elfkind. It was a dream Arwen, nothing more. 

 

Aragorn: This belongs to you. 
Arwen: It was a gift. Keep it. 

 

Èowyn: My lord? 
Aragorn: She is sailing to the undying lands, with all that is left of her kin. 
Gamling: What is it? Hama? 
Hama: I'm not sure. 

 

Legolas: A scout! 
Théoden: What is it? What do you see? 
Aragorn: Wargs! We are under attack! 
Théoden: All riders to the head of the column! 
Gimli: C'mon get me up here, I'm a rider. Agh! 
Théoden: You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste. 
Èowyn: I can fight! 
Théoden: No! You must do this. For me. 
Théoden: Follow me! 
Gimli: Forward, forward, march forward. 
Èowyn:  Make for the lower ground. Stick together! 

 

Gimli: Bring your pretty face to my axe! 

 

Gimli: That one counts as mine! 

 

Gimli: Argh! Stinking creature!" 

 

Gimli: Where is Aragorn? 
Legolas: Aragorn? 

 

Gimli: Where is he? Speak up! 
Orc: Ghehehe, seems like your friend took a little thumble off the cliff. 
Legolas: You lie! 

 

Theoden:  Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead. 

 

Theoden:  Come. 

 
 

Refugees: Helm’s Deep! At last! There it is! 
Old Woman: We’re safe, my lady! Thank you! 

 

Freya: Mama! 
Mother: Freya! Freya! 

 

GUARD: Make way for Théoden! Make way for the King! 

 

Èowyn: So few! So few of you have returned! 
Théoden: Our people are safe. We have paid for it with my many lives. 

 

Gimli: My lady... 
Èowyn:  Lord Aragorn, where is he? 
Gimli:  He fell... 

 


Théoden: Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround. 
GUARD: What of those who cannot fight my lord? The women and children? 
Théoden: Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. 

 

Grima: Helm's Deep has but one weakness. It's outer wall is solid rock for except for a small culvert in space which is little more than a drain. 

 

Grima: How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device can break down a wall? 
Saruman: If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall. 
Grima: Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep. 
Saruman: Tens of thousands. 
Grima: But, my lord, there is no such force. 

 

Saruman: A new power is rising. It's victory is at hand. This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive! To war! There will be no dawn for Men. 

 

Pippin: Look! The smoke to the south! 
Treebeard: There is always smoke rising up from Isengard these days. 
Merry: Isengard? 
Treebeard: There was a time, when Saruman would walk in my woods, but now, he has a mind of metal and wheels. 
Treebeard: He no longer cares for growing things. 

 

Pippin: What is it? 
Merry: It's Saruman's army! The war has started. 

 

Arwen: May the grace of the Valar protect you. 

 
 

Elrond: Arwen. Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.  
Arwen: I've made my choice. 
Elrond: He is not coming back. Why do you linger when there is no hope? 
Arwen: There is still hope. 
Elrond: If Aragorn survives this war, You will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hoped for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you, no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death. An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world. But you, my daughter, you will linger on, in darkness and in doubt. As night falling winter has come without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to you grief, under the fading trees, until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent. Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death. 
A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn? 
Arwen: Gerich meleth nîn, ada.  

 
Galadriel: I amar prestar aen, 
han mathon ne nen, 
han mathon ne chae 
a han noston ned 'wilith. 
The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor. The last free kingdom of men. His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took. In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand to take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. He is close now, so close to achieving his goal. For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth, even until the ending of the world. The time of the elves is over. Do we leave Middle-Earth to this fate? Do we let them stand alone? 

 

Faramir: What news? 
Parn: Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Théoden’s people have fled to Helm’s Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate. 
Faramir: How many? 
Parn: Some thousands. More come every day. 
Faramir: Who’s covering the river to the north? 
Parn: We pulled five hundred men out of Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won’t hold it. 
Faramir: Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him." 
Faramir:  My men tell me that you are Orc spies. 
Sam: Spies! Now wait just a minute! 
Faramir: Well if you’re not spies, then who are you? 
Faramir: Speak! 
Frodo: We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee. 
Faramir: Your bodyguard? 
Sam: His gardener. 
Faramir: And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look. 
Frodo: There was no other. We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. Two were my kin. A dwarf there was also. And an elf. And two men. Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor. 
Faramir: You were friend of Boromir? 
Frodo: Yes, for my part. 
Faramir: It would grieve you then to learn that he is dead? 
Frodo: Dead? How? When? 
Faramir: As one of his companions, I had hoped you would tell me. He was my brother. 

 

Lorne: Captain Faramir. 

 We found the... 

 

Faramir: You must come with me. Now. 

 

Faramir: Down there. 

 

Faramir: To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death. 

 

Faramir: They wait for my command. Shall they shoot? 
Sméagol:  Rock and pool, Is nice and cool, 
So juicy sweeeet. I only wish, To catch a fish, So juicy sweeeeet! 

 

Frodo: Wait. 

 

Frodo: This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide.

 

Frodo: Please, let me go down to him. 

 

Frodo: Sméagol. Master is here.  Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come. 
Sméagol: We must... go now? 
Frodo: Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. That’s it. Come on. 

 

Frodo: Don’t hurt him! Sméagol don’t struggle! Sméagol, listen to me! 
Sméagol: Master! 

 
 

Faramir: Where are you leading them? Answer me! 
Gollum: Sméagol... Why do you cry, Sméagol? 
Sméagol: Cruel men hurts us. Master tricksed us. 
Gollum: Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false. 
Sméagol: Master is our friend... our friend. 
Gollum: Master betrayed ussss! 
Sméagol: No, not it’s business. Leave us alone. 
Gollum: Filthy little hobbitsesss! They stole it from usss! 
Sméagol: No... no... 
Faramir: What did they steal? 
Gollum:  My - PRECIOUS!!!! 

 

Sam: We have to get out of here. You go. Go now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. 
Frodo: I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me. I’m sorry. The Ring’s taking me, Sam. If I put it on, He’ll find me. He’ll see. 
Sam: Mr. Frodo... 

 

Faramir: So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two haflings and a host of men at my call. And the Ring of power within my grasp. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. 
Frodo: No! 
Sam: Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you understand?! He’s got to destroy it. That’s where we’re going. To Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire. 
Malamir: Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. 
Sam: Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not help him? 
Malamir: Captain? 
Faramir: Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. 
 

Aragorn: Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.  

 

Gimli: Where is he! Where is he! Get out of my way! I'm gonna kill him! You are the the luckiest, the cunningest, and most reckless man I ever knew! Bless you, laddie! 
Aragorn: Gimli, where is the king? 

 

Legolas: Le ab-dollen.  You look terrible. 

 

Aragorn: Hannon le.  

 

Théoden: A great host, you say? 
Aragorn: All Isengard is emptied. 
Théoden: How many? 
Aragorn: Ten thousand strong at least. 
Théoden: Ten-thousand?! 
Aragorn: It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of Men. They will be here by nightfall. 
Théoden: Let them come. 

 

Théoden: I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms, to be ready for battle by nightfall. We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg. 
Gimli: This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad. 
Théoden: I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep. They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will pillage and burn. We’ve seen it before. Crops can be resown. Homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them. 
Aragorn: They do not come to destroy Rohan’s crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child! 
Théoden: What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance! 
Aragorn: Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid. 
Théoden: And who will come. Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead. 
Aragorn: Gondor will answer. 
Théoden: Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon... No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. 

 

Théoden: Get the women and children into the caves. 
Gamling: We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord. 
Théoden: There is no time. War is upon us! 
Gamling: Secure the gate. 

 

Treebeard: The ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age: ent moot. 
Merry: What’s that? 
Treebeard: It is a gathering. 
Merry: A gathering of what? 

 

Treebeard: Beech, Oak, Chestnut, Ash. Good, good, good many have come. Now we must decide if the ents will go to war. 

 

Aragorn: Farmers, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers. 
Gimli: Most have seen too many winters. 
Legolas: Or too few. Look at them. They’re frightened. I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hyn: neled herain dan caer menig.  
Aragorn: Si beriathar hýn ammaeg nâ ned Edoras.  
Legolas: Aragorn, nedin dagor hen ú-'erir otheri. Natha daged dhaer.  
Aragorn: Then I shall die as one of them! 

 

Gimli: Let him go, lad. Let him be. 

 

Gamling: Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord? 
Théoden: Who am I, Gamling? 
Gamling: You are our king, sire. 
Théoden: And do you trust your king? 
Gamling: Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end. 
Théoden: To whatever end. Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this? 

 

Aragorn: Give me your sword. What is your name? 
Haleth: Háleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless. 

 

Aragorn: This is a good sword, Háleth, son of Háma. There is always hope. 

 

Legolas: We have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair. 
Aragorn: Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.  

 

Gimli: If we had time, I'd get this adjusted. It’s a little tight across the chest. 

 

Legolas: That is no Orc horn! 

 

Hasslebak: Send for the king. Open the gate! 

 

Théoden: How is this possible? 
Haldir: I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and Men. Long ago we fought and died together. We come to honour that allegiance. 
Aragorn: Mae govannen, Haldir!  
You are most welcome! 
Haldir: We are proud to fight alongside men, once more. 

 

Gimli: Arg... You could have picked a better spot. 

 

Gimli: Well lad, the luck you live by, let’s hope it lasts the night. 
Legolas: Your friends are with you, Aragorn. 
Gimli: Let’s hope they last the night. 

 

Aragorn: A Eruchin, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le. 

Gimli: What’s happening out there? 
Legolas:  Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box? 

 
 

Aragorn: Dartho!  

 

Théoden: So it begins. 
Legolas: Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc! 
Aragorn: Hado i philinn! 
 

 
Gimli: Anybody hit anything? 
Théoden: Give them a volley. 
Gamling: Fire! 
Aragorn: Keep firing! 
Gimli: Come on! Send them to them! 
Aragorn: Pendraith!  
Gimli: Good! 

 

Gimli: Legolas, two already! 
Legolas: I’m on seventeen! 
Gimli: Arg! I’ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! 
Legolas: Nineteen! 


Pippin: Merry! 
Treebeard: We have just agreed. 

 

Merry: Yes? 
Treebeard: I have told your names to the ent moot and we have agreed: you are not Orcs. 
Pippin: Well that’s good news. 
Merry: And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him? 
Treebeard: Now don’t be hasty, Master Meriadoc. 
Merry: Hasty? Our friends are out there. They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own. 
Treebeard: War, yes. It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a long time to say anything in old entish, and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say. 

 

Gimli: Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty one. Twenty two. 
Aragorn: Northway! Nauthannen! 
Théoden: Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman. 

 

Aragorn: Dago han! Dago han, Legolas! Dago han!!!  

 

Théoden: Brace the gates! Hold them! Stand fast!" 

 

Aragorn: Gimli!  


Treebeard: The Ents cannot hold back this war. We must weather such things as we have always done. 
Merry: How can that be your decision? 
Treebeard: This is not our war. 
Merry: But your part of this world! Aren’t you. You must help. Please. You must do something. 
Treebeard: You are young and brave, master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home. 
Pippin: Maybe Treebeard’s right. We don’t belong here, Merry. It’s too big for us. What can we do in the end? We’ve got the Shire. Maybe we should go home. 
Merry: The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckburough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won’t be a Shire, Pippin. 



Théoden: Aragorn, pull back to the gate! 
Aragorn: Na Barad! Na Barad! Haldir! Na Barad!   

 

Gimli: What are you doing? Stop it! 

 

Aragorn: Haldir! 
Gamling: Brace the gate! 
Théoden: To the gate! Draw your swords! 
Gamling: We can’t hold much longer. 
Théoden: Hold them! 

 

Aragorn: How long do you need? 
Théoden: As long as you can give me! 
Aragorn: Gimli! 

 

Gimli: Come on. We can take them! 
Aragorn: It’s a long way. 
Gimli: Toss me. 
Aragorn: What? 
Gimli: I cannot jump the distance so you have to toss me. Ehh.. Don’t tell the elf. 
Aragorn: Not a word. 

 

Théoden: Shore up the door! Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there! 
Legolas:  Aragorn! 

 

Théoden: Pull everybody back. Pull them back! 
Gamling: Pull back! Pull back! Retreat! Retreat! 
Aragorn: Hurry! Get them inside! Come, to the keep! 



Treebeard: I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there. 
Pippin: Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south! 
Treebeard: South? But that will lead you past Isengard. 
Pippin: Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll expect. 
Treebeard: Hmmmm. That doesn’t make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps your right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill. 
Merry: Are you mad, we’ll be caught. 
Pippin: No we won’t. Not this time. 

 

Parn: Look. Osgiliath burns. Mordor has come. 
Frodo: The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go. 

 

Faramir: Hurry. 
Frodo:  Faramir, you must let me go! 



Treebeard: ... and a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and it tickles me awfully. They’re always trying to get somewhere...

 

Treebeard: Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. 
Pippin: I’m sorry, Treebeard. 
Treebeard: They had voices of their own. Saruman. A wizard should know better! 

 

Treebeard:  There is no curse in elvish, entish or the tongues of men for this treachery! My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone. 

 

Merry: Yes! 
Treebeard: Rárum-rum! Come my friends. The ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the ents. 

Parn: Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we’ll be overrun. 

 

Sam: Mr. Frodo! 
Frodo:  It’s calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me. 

 

Sam: Hold on, Mr. Frodo. It'll be alright.  
Faramir:  Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. 
Sam: You wanna know what happened to Boromir? You wanna know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo. After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad! 
 

Sam: Mr. Frodo? 
Frodo: They’re here. They’ve come. 
Ringwraith:  
Faramir: Nazgûl! 

 

Faramir: Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover! 


Théoden: The fortress is taken. It is over. 
Aragorn: You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it! Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way? 
Gamling: There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many. 
Aragorn: Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance! 
Théoden: So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate? 
Aragorn: Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them." 
Théoden: For death and glory? 
Aragorn: For Rohan. For your people. 
Gimli: The sun is rising. 
 Gandalf: Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn look to the East. 
Théoden: Yes. Yes! The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time. 
Gimli: Yes! 

 

Théoden: Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds await. Now for wrath. Now for ruin. And the red dawn! 
Théoden: Forth Eorlingas! 

 

Aragorn: Gandalf. 
Gandalf: Théoden-king stands alone. 

 

Èomer: Not alone. Rohirrim! 
Théoden: Èomer! 
Èomer: To the king! 

 
 

Treebeard: A hit. A fine hit. Break the dam! Release the river! 
Merry: Pippin, hold on! 
Treebeard: Hold on, little hobbits! 



Sam: What are you doing? Where are you going? 

 

Sam: It’s me. It’s your Sam. Don’t you know your Sam? 

 

Frodo: I can’t do this, Sam. 
Sam: I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are. It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened. 

 

Sam: But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. 

 

Sam: Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something. 
Frodo: What are we holding on to, Sam? 
Sam: That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for. 

 
 

Faramir: I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. 

 

Manathor: You know the laws of our country. The laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit. 

 

Faramir:  Release them. 

 


Gandalf: Sauron’s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helm’s Deep is over. The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness. 



Sam: I wonder if we’ll ever be put into songs or tales. 
Frodo: What? 
Sam: I wonder if people will ever say, ‘let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring.’ 
And they’ll say, ‘yes, that’s one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn’t he, dad.’ 
‘Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that’s saying alot.’ 
Frodo: ‘You left out one of the chief characters. Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam. Frodo wouldn’t have got far without Sam.’ 
Sam: Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun. I was being serious. 
Frodo: So was I. 
Sam: Samwise the Brave. 
Frodo: Sméagol! 
Sam: We’re not gonna wait for you. Come on. 

 

Sméagol: Master... Master looks after us. Master wouldn’t hurt us. 
Gollum: Master broke his promise! 
Sméagol: Don’t ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol. 
Gollum: Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false! We ought to ring his filthy little neck! Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both. Then we take the Preciousss and we be the master. 
Sméagol: But the fat hobbit. He knows. Eyes always watching. 
Gollum: Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyses. And make him crawl. 
Sméagol: Yes! Yes! Yes! 
Gollum: Kill them both. 
Sméagol: Yes! No. No. It’s too risky, it’s too risky. 
Sam: Where’s he gone? Oi! Gollum, where are you? 
Frodo: Sméagol? 
Gollum: We could let her do it. 
Sméagol: Yes. She could do it. 
Gollum: Yes, Precious she could. And then we takes it once they’re dead. 
Sméagol: Once they’re dead. Hush! 

 

Smèagol: Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Sméagol will show you the way. Follow me.
