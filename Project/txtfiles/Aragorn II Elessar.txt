'''Aragorn II''', son of [[Arathorn II]] and [[Gilraen]], also known as '''Elessar''' and '''Strider''', was the 16th and last [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North]]; later crowned '''King Elessar Telcontar''' ([[March 1]], [[TA 2931|2931]] - [[FO 120]] or SR 1541), the 26th [[King of Arnor]], 35th [[King of Gondor]] and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of [[Isildur]]. He was a great Ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of [[Narsil]], reforged and renamed [[Andúril|''Andúril'']]'', Flame of the West'', in the [[War of the Ring]]. 
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
[[File:Aragorntoddler.jpg|thumb|225px|Aragorn as a toddler, portrayed by [[Luke Johnston]] in the fan film ''[[Born of Hope]]'']]
{{Blockquote|He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]}}

Aragorn was a descendant of [[Elros|Elros Tar-Minyatur]] through the line of the [[Lords of Andúnië]] to [[Elendil]], High King of Arnor and Gondor. His ancestor [[Arvedui]] was wedded to [[Fíriel]], who was descended from [[Anárion]], who bore their son [[Aranarth]], making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and Anárion.

When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing [[Orcs]]. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in [[Rivendell]] by [[Elrond]]. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and [[Heir of Isildur]] became known. Aragorn was renamed "Estel" and was not told about his heritage until [[TA 2951|2951]].<ref name="tale">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (v): "The tale of Aragorn and Arwen"</ref>

[[File:Anna_Lee_-_Young_Aragorn.jpg|thumb|322x322px|Young Aragorn with the shards of [[Narsil]], by [http://ilxwing.deviantart.com/ Anna Lee] ]]

Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the [[Ring of Barahir]] and the [[Narsil|Shards of Narsil]]. Elrond withheld the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] from Aragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with [[Arwen]], Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of [[Lothlórien]] where she had been visiting her grandmother [[Galadriel]].<ref name="tale" />

Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the [[Rangers of the North]], whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the [[Angmar war|Angmar Wars]] centuries before.<ref name="tale" />

Aragorn met [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] in [[TA 2956|2956]] and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the [[Shire]] inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian [[Hobbit]]s, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as '''Strider'''.

From [[TA 2957]] to [[TA 2980]], Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] of [[Gondor]]. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of [[Sauron]] and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the [[War of the Ring]]. Aragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was '''Thorongil''' ("Eagle of the Star"). With a small squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an [[Raid on Umbar|assault]] on the long-standing [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] city of [[Umbar]] in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' [[ship]]s and personally slaying their lord during the battle. After the victory at Umbar, "Thorongil" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.<ref name="stewards">''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix A: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (iv): "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion", The Stewards</ref>

Later in 2980, he visited Lothlórien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the [[Ring of Barahir]], and, on the hill of [[Cerin Amroth]], Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the [[Gift of Men]]; death.<ref name="tale" />

Elrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of "both" Gondor and [[Arnor]]. As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.<ref name="tale" />

Before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'' properly take place, Aragorn traveled widely through Middle-earth, entering the [[Dwarven]] mines of [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]] via the [[East-gate of Moria]] but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to [[Harad]], where (in his own words) "the stars are strange". [[Tolkien]] does not specify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happened during Aragorn's visits.[[File:Aragorn hunt for gollum.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Aragorn the Ranger in the wild, from the fan film ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]''|left]]In [[TA 3009]], Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to the [[Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], which later turned out to be the [[One Ring]], the key to the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]'s power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the [[Shire]], Aragorn went at Gandalf's request into [[Rhovanion]] in search of [[Gollum]], who had once possessed the Ring. He caught the creature in the [[Dead Marshes]] near [[Mordor]], and brought him as a captive to [[Thranduil]]'s [[Elvenking's Halls|Halls]] in [[Mirkwood]], where Gandalf questioned him.<ref name="council">''The Lord of the Rings, The [[Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book Two, Chapter II: "[[The Council of Elrond (chapter)|The Council of Elrond]]"</ref> Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron's [[Orcs]].

=== War of the Ring ===
{{Blockquote|What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider.|[[Barliman Butterbur]], speaking of Aragorn in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]"}}

==== Escorting the hobbits ====
[[File:Strider in Prancing Pony - FOTR.png|thumb|200px|Strider at ''The Prancing Pony'' in Bree]]

Aragorn returned with Gandalf in the spring of [[TA 3018]], and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Gandalf discovered the [[Nazgûl]] were seeking for [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and the Ring in the Shire. After Frodo left [[Hobbiton]], [[Gildor Inglorion]] informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the [[Great East Road]] until [[Tom Bombadil]] and the four hobbits came from the [[Barrow-downs]]. Following them to [[Bree]], he met Frodo at [[The Prancing Pony|Inn of the Prancing Pony]] under the name "Strider," as the [[Men of Bree]] called him.<ref name="prancing">''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book One, Chapter IX: "[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]"</ref> Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, [[Barliman Butterbur]] brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him.<ref name="strider">''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book One, Chapter X: "Strider"</ref> Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal [[Númenórean]] descent.

After the raid on Bree, Aragorn led the Hobbits out of [[Bree-land]] and through the [[Midgewater Marshes]]. While there, he saw Gandalf's battle with the Nazgûl on [[Weathertop]] from a distance. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered five of the Nazgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Ringwraiths. After attempting to heal Frodo with [[athelas]], he led them across the [[Lone-lands]] towards the [[Trollshaws]].<ref name="knife">''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book One, Chapter XI: "[[A Knife in the Dark]]"</ref> They met with the elf-lord [[Glorfindel]] who led them to the [[Ford of Bruinen]]. When the Nazgûl caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book One, Chapter XII: "[[Flight to the Ford]]"</ref>

During the feast of victory, Aragorn was gathering news from [[Elladan and Elrohir]], and later helped his friend [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] compose his Lay of [[Eärendil]]. During the [[Council of Elrond]], he revealed himself to [[Boromir]] as the heir of Isildur and described his capture of Gollum. After Elrond decided that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself. There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the [[Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship of the Ring]], tasked with accompanying Frodo in destroying the Ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], his best friend [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Legolas]] the Elf, [[Gimli]] the Dwarf, and [[Boromir]] of Gondor.<ref name="council" />

All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;

:— Bilbo's poem about Aragorn<ref name="strider" />

Before the group set out, the shards of [[Narsil]] were re-forged, and the restored blade was named [[Andúril]].

==== Accompanying the Fellowship ====
{{Expansion}}
Aragorn and Gandalf had been planning their journey to Mordor for weeks. He and Gandalf guided the Fellowship south along the line of the [[Misty Mountains]]. When they came to [[Eregion|Hollin]], Aragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the [[Crebain]] who were spying out the land for [[Saruman]]. He then convinced Gandalf to try the pass over [[Caradhras]]. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by Sauron, and were forced to retreat. Aragorn, together with Boromir, made a path through the snow for the Fellowship to escape.

After it was proposed to go through [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]], Aragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the [[Wargs]] that attacked them during the night. Helping to rescue Frodo from the [[Watcher in the Water]], once the company entered Moria, Aragorn remained at the back and noticed Gollum beginning to follow them. After they were [[Skirmish in Balin's Tomb|attacked]] in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], Aragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or [[Cave-troll]] in the movies) that had seemingly killed Frodo. During Gandalf's battle with the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] on the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]], Aragorn ran to his side and became the Fellowship's leader after Gandalf fell, presumed dead.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book Two, Chapter V: "[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]"</ref> Aragorn then led the company to Lothlórien, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady [[Galadriel]] gave him the [[Elfstone|Elfstone]].<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book Two, Chapter VIII: "[[Farewell to Lorien]]"</ref>

After Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river [[Anduin]] to the [[Falls of Rauros]]. Aragorn attempted to catch Gollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Frodo after the loss of Gandalf and was conflicted about what path to take.<ref name="greatriver" />

==== Breaking of the Fellowship ====
{{Blockquote|Fear not! he said. "Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anarion, my sires of old.

After passing the [[Argonath]], the Fellowship camped at [[Parth Galen]]. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] saw that [[Boromir]] had been driven mad by the influence of the [[One Ring]], trying to take it. Frodo put the Ring on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen; from there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt the eye but the Dark Lord was distracted by Gandalf the White. 

[[File:Aragorn_Close_up_-_FOTR.png|thumb|right|250px|Aragorn at [[Amon Hen]]]]

At this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's [[Uruk-hai]] and a battle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending Merry and Pippin, expressing his remorse privately to Aragorn for trying to take the Ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and the others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to rescue Merry and Pippin. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and war gear in one of the elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to Boromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent over the Falls of Rauros.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring'', Book Two, Chapter X: "[[The Breaking of the Fellowship]]"</ref>

While Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli went to [[Rohan]] to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.

=== The Three Hunters ===

[[File:Ted_Nasmith_-_Pursuit_in_Rohan.jpg|thumb|260px|The Three Hunters, by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Aragorn ran from Parth Galen across the width of Rohan in just four days. As they approached [[Fangorn Forest]], the "Three Hunters" Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encountered [[Éomer]], who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been found. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle. Clues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, [[The Two Towers]]'', Book Three, Chapter II: "The Riders of Rohan"</ref> They did not find the Hobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters that the Hobbits were safe with the [[Ent]]s of Fangorn.<ref name="whiterider" />

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar?
Where do thy kinsfolk wander afar?

The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.</poem>
:- Galadriel's message to Aragorn<ref name="whiterider">''The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers'', Book Three, Chapter V: "[[The White Rider]]"</ref>

Together, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to [[Edoras]], where Gandalf freed [[Théoden]] from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the [[Rohirrim]] against Saruman.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers,'' Book Three, Chapter VI: "[[The King of the Golden Hall]]"</ref> He allied with Théoden and led the refugees to [[Helm's Deep]].

[[File:Shin_Lin_-_Night_Battle_on_Helm's_Deep.jpg|thumb|260px|Night Battle on Helm's Deep, by Shin Lin]]

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli then helped the people of Rohan in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], in which they conclusively defeated Saruman's army.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers'', Book Three, Chapter VII: "[[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]]"</ref> Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to [[Isengard]], only to find it in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being present with Gandalf, Théoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiated in a final parley with Saruman. Saruman attempted to bend Théoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Saruman. Saruman also attempted to sway Gandalf, but failed in this also, and even so Gandalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. Saruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to Sauron, and thus Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and the [[White Council]]. After Saruman crawled away, [[Gríma Wormtongue]] threw the [[Palantíri|Palantír]] of [[Orthanc]] at Gandalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard. After Pippin revealed himself to Sauron in the stone, Gandalf gave the palantír back to Aragorn.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers'', Book Three, Chapter VIII: "[[The Road to Isengard]]"</ref>

Not long after the [[Grey Company]] of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by Galadriel. With them rode [[Elladan and Elrohir]] and [[Halbarad]], bearing a [[Aragorn's standard|standard]] made for him by Arwen. When Aragorn returned to Helms Deep, he decided to draw Sauron out and used the Stone to show himself and Andúril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the [[Dark Lord]]. However, this led Sauron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack [[Minas Tirith]].

=== Return of the King ===

[[File:Aragorn_and_army_of_dead.jpg|thumb|260px|Aragorn and the Army of the Dead attack the Orcs]]

In order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the [[Paths of the Dead]], and summoned the [[Army of the Dead|Dead Men of Dunharrow]] who owed allegiance to the Heir of Isildur. It had been prophesied by Isildur and [[Malbeth the Seer]] that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor an age before. With their aid the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] were defeated at the [[Battle of Pelargir]].<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter II: "The Passing of the Gray Company"</ref>

Aragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas Tirith. When they arrived at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Aragorn unfurled a [[Aragorn's standard|standard]] that Arwen had made for him which showed both the [[White Tree of Gondor]] along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Gondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.<ref name="pelennor">''The Lord of the Rings'','' The Return of the King'', Book Five, Chapter VI: "[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]"</ref>

The Steward [[Denethor II]] declared that he would not bow to a descendant of Isildur (years before, he had seen "Thorongil" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. Aragorn healed [[Faramir]], Denethor's last heir, [[Éowyn]] and Merry, who together slew the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-King]] as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as [[Ioreth]] said, ''"The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known."'' The people hailed him as King that same evening.<ref name="houses">''The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King'', Book Five, Chapter VIII: "[[The Houses of Healing]]"</ref>

Despite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for Gondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of [[March 15]]–[[March 16|16]], he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on [[May 1]].

=== Captain of the West ===
Aragorn then led the Host of the West to Mordor as per the advice of Gandalf and Elrond, to divert Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam. They marched over the Anduin river and came to [[Minas Morgul]], and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the [[Cross-roads]], they began to march north through [[Ithilien]], and Aragorn won a skirmish against some Orcs and Easterlings that tried to [[Ambush in Ithilien|ambush]] them. They then reached the desert before Mordor, and Aragorn allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake [[Cair Andros]]. The Army of the West then reached the [[Black Gate]], and Aragorn along with Gandalf, Éomer, [[Imrahil]], Pippin, Legolas and Gimli rode up to it and called for Sauron to come forth. He then watched as the [[Mouth of Sauron]] revealed Sauron knew about Frodo and Sam, and saw Gandalf's rejection of Sauron's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by Sauron's forces, a vast army of Orcs and Men. Aragorn then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two [[Slag Hills]] and the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] began.

After the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn presided over the clearing out of the final Orcs in Mordor, the freeing of the slaves of [[Núrn]] and the healing of the Host.

[[File:King_Aragorn.PNG|thumb|220px|Aragorn, son of Arathorn, King of Gondor]]

Upon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was [[Crowning of King Elessar|crowned]] as '''King Elessar''', a name given to him by [[Galadriel]] and adopted by the people of Gondor because of the [[Elfstone]] he wore. He became the '''twenty-sixth [[King of Arnor]]''', '''thirty-fifth [[King of Gondor]]''', and the first '''High King of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]''', though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in Arnor. His line was referred to as the [[House of Telcontar]] (Telcontar being [[Quenya]] for "Strider"). Aragorn married Arwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120 of the [[Fourth Age]]. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]], re-establishing rule over all the territory that Gondor had lost in previous centuries.
<br clear="left" />
During his coronation, Aragorn spoke Elendil's Oath: ''"Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!"'' ("Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place, I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.")<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King'', Book Six, Chapter V: "[[The Steward and the King]]"</ref>

[[File:Aragorn's_death.png|thumb|260px|Aragorn's funeral]]

When in the year [[FO 120|120]] of the [[Fourth Age]], King Elessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the [[Rath Dínen|Silent Street]]. He said farewell to his son [[Eldarion]] and his daughters and gave Eldarion his [[Crown of Gondor|crown]] and [[Sceptre of Annúminas|sceptre]]. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died. A year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died in Lothlórien of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.<ref name="tale" />

== Character ==
{{Blockquote|Was there ever anyone like him? Except Gandalf, of course. I think they must be related.|[[Peregrin Took]] on Aragorn<ref name=houses/>}}[[File:Strider.jpg|thumb|272px|An artist's conception of Aragorn at [[The Prancing Pony]]]]Tolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'': lean, dark, tall, with "a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes."<ref name="prancing" />

In ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'', he was said to be often grim and sad, with unexpected moments of levity.<ref name="tale" /> Some time after the publications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches tall.

Aragorn possessed [[Elven]] wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with Elrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer, notably with the plant ''[[Athelas]]'' (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also a mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], he, [[Éomer]], and [[Imrahil]] were said to be left unscathed, even though they had been in the thick of the fighting.

Though there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny as the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the war against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not immune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while leading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed himself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.

On one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to complications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword [[Andúril]] (a priceless ancient heirloom and the weapon which cut the ring from Sauron's hand) at the door of [[Edoras]], as [[Théoden]] had required, and only did so after Gandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he swore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by his own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).

He also appeared to possess a nigh-indomitable will. At one point, he was able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of Orthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that even Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of challenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. His fortitude in the face of the Army of the Dead was unwavering and his companions remarked that he was mighty indeed in the strength of his will. He was accounted as "the hardiest of living Men" during his lifetime.

== Etymology ==

The name '''''Aragorn''''' means "Revered King", from the [[Sindarin]] ''ara'' ("king") and ''(n)gorn'' ("revered")<ref name="parma" />. Aragorn was named after [[Aragorn I]].

*'''Elfstone''' - [[Westron]] translation of Elessar
*'''Estel''' - Aragorn's nickname during his childhood in [[Rivendell]]. It means "Hope"<ref name="parma">''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'', Words, Phrases and Passages in Various Tongues in ''The Lord of the Rings'' by J.R.R. Tolkien</ref>
*'''Longshanks''' - Used by [[Samwise Gamgee]] and some of the Men of Bree<ref name="knife" />
*'''Stick-at-naught Strider''' - Used by the Men of Bree, in particular [[Bill Ferny]] <ref name="knife" />

*'''Wingfoot''' - Given by Éomer<ref name="riders">''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Two Towers'', Book Three, Chapter II: "[[The Riders of Rohan]]"</ref>

=== Titles ===
As king, Aragorn had many titles:

*'''The Dúnadan'''
*'''Chieftain of the Dúnedain'''
*'''Heir of Isildur'''
*'''Heir of Elendil'''
*'''King of all the Dúnedain'''
*'''King of the West'''
*'''[[Envinyatar]]''' - "the Renewer"<ref name="pelennor" />
*'''King of Gondor'''
*'''King of Arnor'''
*'''High King of Gondor and Arnor'''
*'''Lord of the House of Telcontar'''

== Behind the scenes ==

The restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a subplot of ''The Lord of the Rings''; Aragorn's adventures not only aid Frodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which, though his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to historical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have been under the rule of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] for centuries, as it was widely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. After the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], [[Meneldil]], son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from Arnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with the northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This arrangement had been reinforced by the Steward [[Pelendur]] after nearly 2,000 years when he rejected [[Arvedui]]'s claim to the Throne of Gondor during a succession crisis ([[Eärnil I|Eärnil]], a member of the [[House of Anárion]], was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting, however, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had married a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a descendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.

=== Concept and creation ===

==== Identity ====
The "first term" of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or Strider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of Frodo Baggins) at the [[inn]] of [[The Prancing Pony]]. His description and behavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the difference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter for the "clitter-clap" sound that they produced. He was also accounted to be "one of the wild folk — rangers", and he played the same role in Frodo's journey to Rivendell as in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Later Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of "Trotter" for a long time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits as originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either a Man or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was "very well known" (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of Bingo: "I keep on feeling that I have seen him somewhere before". Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo Baggins himself, but rejected that idea.

Another suggestion was that Trotter was "Fosco Took (Bilbo's first cousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf". This story was further elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin Boffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after he came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped Gandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why Trotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in Mordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien in the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had wooden feet.

The conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the following recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make Trotter "a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell", and a scout from Rivendell who "pretends to be a ranger".<ref>''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol. 7: ''The Treason of Isengard'', I: "Gandalf's Delay"</ref>

Quite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter, from the beginning introducing him as a "descendant of the ancient men of the North, and one of Elrond's household", as well as the name Aragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of [[Elros]] and Elendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and would come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character of Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second and Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association with them.

==== Further character developments ====
The development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex, as was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's forefathers were the exiles of [[Númenor]] who ruled over the people of Ond (the early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King "when Sauron raised a rebellion". The story of the two branches of Elendil's descendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations only emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have conceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.

One significant feature which was not established until late stages was Aragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn, the interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with suggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story. Another proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge Théoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.

The first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in reference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the full tale of Aragorn and Arwen.

A passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he would accordingly be titled the "Lord of the Ring".

==== Rejected names ====
The original nickname '''Trotter''' was retained for a long while, and Tolkien decided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed. There were also several experimental translations of Trotter to Sindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly being equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title "the Dúnadan", Quenya Tarkil ("Noble Man") was first used, synonym with Númenórean.

Tolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's "real" name. Although Aragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an Elvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via Elfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing "west". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: Galadriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to Elfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of Elessar.

Among other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered Elfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with various Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name of Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien intended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling upon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim with [[Ingold]].<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 7: ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', XIV: "Farewell to Lórien"</ref>

== History and mythology ==

Richard J. Finn presented a paper entitled "Arthur and Aragorn - Arthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on Medieval Studies". The are additional similarities between Aragorn and Arthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings of Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the period in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh, still known as ''Dùn Éideann'' in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to Dúnadan. For "Men of the North", Goddodin was a far northern kingdom. Arthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for which he was called "His Grey Eminence" - Gandalf the White also wore a gray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf the Grey.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

[[File:Aragorn_3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Viggo Mortensen]] as Aragorn II]]

In [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy]] ([[2001]] – [[2003]]) directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Aragorn is played by [[wikipedia:Danish-American|Danish-American]] actor [[Viggo Mortensen]], who took over the role from [[wikipedia:Stuart Townsend|Stuart Townsend]] after a month of rehearsals. In these movies, Aragorn must overcome his self-doubt to claim the kingship. This specific element of self-doubt is not present in Tolkien's books, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne all along. [[wikipedia:Daniel Day-Lewis|Daniel Day-Lewis]] was offered the role, but declined.

In order to ensure safe passage across Mordor for Frodo to fulfill his quest, Aragorn then led the Army of the West out from [[Minas Tirith]] to make a diversionary feint on the [[Black Gate|Black Gate of Mordor]] itself in the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. Gandalf had been given supreme command of the war effort after the Pelennor Fields, and acted as chief spokesman in the parley with the [[Mouth of Sauron]]; but Aragorn commanded the Allied troops during the battle and its aftermath.

==== Non-Canonical weapons ====
In the film adaptation, Aragorn never carries the shards of Narsil as he did in the books, and only receives the reforged Andúril before entering the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Up until this time, Aragorn uses a different, more basic sword that is never given a name. Attached to the scabbard of this sword is a small utility knife that Aragorn uses in the wild country.

*Dagger

[[File:Celeborn's_gift_to_Aragorn.jpg|thumb|260px|Aragorn's dagger given by [[Celeborn]]]]

Aragorn also uses a long, curved dagger in battle, though a lot less frequently than his sword. This dagger is used for close combat and as a last resort if the sword is useless in a particular situation, such as when Aragorn is knocked down or assassinating Sauron's servants. He received a curved dagger from [[Celeborn]] in the movie, upon leaving Lorien. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)]]'', Aragorn uses his dagger as a finishing blow for his Final Judgment and Warrior Bane combos. 

*Bow and arrows

[[File:Battle_of_Moria.png|thumb|260px|Aragorn with a bow in the [[Balin's Tomb]] sequence]]

Aragorn's next weapon in his arsenal is his bow. This bow is rarely used at all. Aragorn only uses it in Moria, shooting Goblins in the beginning of the [[Fight in Balin's Tomb]] and while fleeing the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. During these few scenes, Aragorn shows that, though he does not have the expert bow skill and speed that [[Legolas]] possesses, he is still an effective shooter when he successfully brings down two goblins through small cracks in the door.

In "The Two Towers" and "Return of the King" video games, Aragorn's missile weapon is his bow and arrows. In each case, Aragorn has 30 arrows.

*The Black Stone

[[File:Aragorn_holding_a_Palantir_01.JPG|thumb|260px|Aragorn with the [[Palantir]]]]

Aragorn's final weapon is the Black Stone. He uses it once in ''The Return of the King'' to summon the Oathbreakers and defeat the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. He is not shown using it in the movie adaptation.

In ''LOTR: Conquest'', Aragorn's special, heavy attack is to summon the Army of the Dead.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', Aragorn's most powerful ability is to summon the Army of the Dead, which appears as four abnormally large, invincible ghost units, who can kill infantry almost instantly, though they are weak against buildings. The only units capable of doing any sort of damage to the Dead are heroes, which even then get immediately wiped out.

=== The Hobbit film trilogy ===
While not appearing physically in Peter Jackson's ''The Hobbit ''trilogy, he is alluded to by [[Thranduil]] to Legolas in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]. ''In a departure from the books, he is stated to already be a Ranger and well known among his people, rather than a ten year old child. Thranduil only told him that the Ranger's name was Strider and that he was the son of Arathorn, telling him that he would have to find out Strider's true name for himself.

Given that Aragorn was 87 in ''The Two Towers'', he would have been 27 during the Hobbit film series, since the original trilogy omitted the 17 year gap between where Gandalf leaves Frodo and finds out about the Ring's origin.
[[File:Ralph Bakshi's Aragorn.PNG|thumb|249x249px|Ralph Bakshi's Aragorn]]

=== Ralph Bakshi version ===

Aragorn was voiced by [[John Hurt]] in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 animated film version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 movie)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. Bakshi's Aragorn, unlike all other portrayals that were to follow to date, has no beard. This actually conforms to a statement appearing in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that implicitly says that Aragorn was not supposed to have one, due to his Elvish ancestry (Elves did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or later, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of Middle-earth, there is a discussion of the Elvish strain in Men, as to its being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended (it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless. However, Tolkien actually wrote elsewhere that Elves ''did'' have beards; in ''The Lord of the Rings'' itself [[Círdan]] is described as having a beard. Also, some viewers and critics have said that this version of Aragorn looks [[wikipedia:Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] though not necessarily to the detriment of the film.
[[File:Rankin-Bass Aragorn.PNG|thumb|255x255px|Rankin/Bass's Aragorn]]

=== Rankin/Bass' Return of the King ===

Aragorn was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 [[Rankin/Bass]] animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', made for television. He first appears at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, leading the reinforcements from southern Gondor.

=== Stage ===

(See the stage article: ''[[wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings (musical)|The Lord of the Rings]]'')

Aragorn was portrayed by [[wikipedia:Evan Buliung|Evan Buliung]] in the three-hour production of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' which opened in 2006 in [[wikipedia:Toronto|Toronto]], [[wikipedia:Canada|Canada]].

== Trivia ==
{{Trivia}}
* Aragorn is also descended from the House of Finwë, since Idril is his ancestor Elros' grandmother, Turgon is his grandfather, and Fingolfin is his great-grandfather.

*Near the end of the first movie ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', in the scene where Aragorn fights the Uruk-hai Captain [[Lurtz]], Aragorn uses his sword to deflect his Elvish dagger, which Lurtz threw at him after he stabbed him in the leg with it. This was not meant to happen as in the original script the knife was supposed to miss and hit the tree behind Aragorn, though the mask Lurtz's actor was wearing restricted his vision, causing him to miss his mark and throw the knife directly at Aragorn. Luckily he was able to use his sword to deflect the knife just in time. The director decided to keep that scene rather than the originally planned scene, as he did just barely manage to knock the dagger away.

*At one point, Viggo Mortensen is approached by one of the producers of [[The Hobbit (films)|''The Hobbit'']] film, asking him if he would like to reprise his role as Aragorn. Viggo replies that, ''"You do know, don’t you, that Aragorn isn’t in The Hobbit? That there is a 60-year gap between the books?"''{{Fact}}

*Although Aragorn does not appear in the ''The Hobbit'' trilogy, he is briefly mentioned by [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]] towards the end of the third installment, ''The Battle of the Five Armies''. He is referred to as "Strider", a member of the Dúnedain Rangers, and a son of Arathorn.
*He has been speculated to be a member of the ISTJ personality type.<ref>https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/lord-of-the-rings-personality-chart/</ref> However, many believe him to be an INFJ or ISTP.
