Mauhúr was sent to reinforce [[Uglúk]] and the [[Uruk-hai Scouts]] as they returned to [[Isengard]] with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. He found them surrounded by [[Éomer]]'s [[Rohirrim]] [[Éored|''éored'']] at the edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], from which he led his [[Uruk-hai]] in an attack.
