'''Farmer Maggot''' was a [[hobbit]] farmer who lived at [[Bamfurlong]], which was located in the [[Marish]] region of the [[Shire]]'s [[Eastfarthing]].

== Biography ==

Farmer Maggot had a large turnip-field and mushrooms grew abundantly on his land. Farmer Maggot often had to deal with hobbits, like [[Frodo Baggins]], stealing his mushrooms and was ferocious to trespassers. Farmer Maggot was married to [[Mrs. Maggot]] and had at least two sons and three daughters. At least two other hobbits also belonged to the farm household. He owned three dogs, [[Grip, Fang and Wolf]], and used them to chase off any trespassers. 

His family served Frodo Baggins, [[Sam Gamgee]], and [[Peregrin Took]] supper when they accidentally trespassed on their farm. Maggot told the hobbits that a "strange man" had earlier attempted to bribe him for the location of "Baggins", though Maggot chased him off. Maggot later drove the hobbits to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon, where they met [[Merry Brandybuck]], and afterwards returned to his own home.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'','' [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter IV: "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]"</ref>

He was known to be acquainted with [[Tom Bombadil]], who respected him greatly.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'','' [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter VII: "[[In the House of Tom Bombadil]]"</ref>

== Etymology ==

According to [[Tolkien]], ''maggot'' was an old Hobbitish name lost in history and its meaning unknown. It may be a reference to the English word ''maggot'' or ''grub'', and may have connections with the Marish's fertile and boggy land in which ''maggots'' or ''grubs'' feed.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Farmer Maggot.jpg|thumb|right|Farmer Maggot in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
Farmer Maggot is seen in the film ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', directing the Black Riders to Hobbiton when they arrive at his house in search of the Ring; in another scene, his voice is heard yelling at [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] for stealing from his fields. In the film, his crops appeared to include corn, cabbages and carrots, as well as other vegetables.

He also is seen/mentioned briefly in two LEGO games. In ''LEGO The Lord of the Rings'', his dialogue from the film is dubbed in and he is as seen as a body passing between rows of crops; the Hobbits leave all the stolen carrots in the hooves of a pig, making it a scapegoat for Farmer Maggot to catch. In ''LEGO The Hobbit'', two random Hobbits near his farm will wonder openly if they should be getting food from someone named Farmer ''Maggot''.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Farmer Maggot can be found at his farm in [[Bamfurlong]] at the [[Marish]] next to his son, Hammy Maggot. He is involved in several minor quests and the annual "Farmer's Faire" festival.
