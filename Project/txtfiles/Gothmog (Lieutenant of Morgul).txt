'''Gothmog''' was the lieutenant of the [[Witch-king]] in the [[Third Age]] from [[Minas Morgul]], notably serving at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

== Biography ==

Gothmog was mentioned only once in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, following the loss of his master: in response to the arrival of the [[Rohirrim]], he called his army's reserve out of [[Osgiliath]] and into the main battle, and brought [[Easterlings]], [[Southrons]], [[Variag]]s, and [[Half-trolls|Troll-men]]'' ''"into the fray".<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']], Book Five, Ch. VI: "[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]"</ref>

Gothmog's race is wholly unspecified in the books. He is assumed in various media to be an Orc or [[Black Númenórean]].<ref name="EoA_Gothmog">''[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/gothmog2.html Gothmog, Lieutenant of Morgul],'' [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.asp The Encyclopedia of Arda]</ref>

=== Peter Jackson's ''The Return of the King'' ===
{{Quote|The age of Men is over. The time of the Orc has come!|Gothmog}}
In ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', Gothmog is portrayed as a deformed [[Morannon Orc|Morannon orc]]-general with a crippled left arm, and his role is expanded from his brief mention in the books.[[File:GOTHMOG_of_M.M..jpg|thumb|left|290px|Gothmog at overtaken Osgiliath]]

Although his name is not spoken in the film, officially-licensed merchandise confirms that this character is meant to represent the same Gothmog mentioned in the novel. He is first seen commanding the [[Orc]]s crossing the [[Anduin]] river to the western half of Osgiliath, which was still held by Men, and orders the first shot fired in the [[Battle of Osgiliath]]. After Faramir's retreat, a second legion enters the city from [[Minas Morgul]] via the bridge that the Orcs who controlled the eastern side of the city had rebuilt.

The [[Men of Gondor|troops of Gondor]] retreated, leaving behind their wounded, one of whom is [[Madril]], the badly-wounded captain of the [[Ithilien]] rangers, whom Gothmog kills with a spear. The [[Witch-King|Witch-king]], arrived from [[Minas Morgul]], then instructs him to assault [[Minas Tirith]] using all legions at his disposal. When Gothmog asks about Gandalf, the Witch-king replies that he will "break him".

When [[Faramir]] rides out with a small band of Gondor Knights on horseback, attempting to retake the city, Gothmog orders his archers to fire a volley from the ruins of [[Osgiliath]] which kill the knights save Faramir. Once his forces arrive on the [[Pelennor Fields]], he orders the heads of the dead soldiers in Osgiliath to be launched off the [[catapult]]s, to instill fear into the hearts of [[Gondor]]'s soldiers and destroy their morale.

Gothmog then begins directing the main ground operations, from catapults to siege-towers. He becomes enraged when the doors into the city won't budge, ordering [[Grond]] to be brought forth to smash it down. When the defenders of Gondor start launching debris at the attackers with trebuchets, Gothmog orders his troops to hold still. When a large piece of the debris is launched directly at him, Gothmog waits until the last second before sidestepping to avoid it by about a foot, prompting him to mock his opponents by spitting on it. His lieutenants are [[Guritz]], with the skull on his helmet, who seemed to be the siege commander, and [[Murgash]], a [[Black Uruk]].

In the theatrical release, Gothmog is presumed dead after the [[Rohirrim]]'s charge as he is last seen trying to back away as the Rohirrim kill his men.

In the extended edition, he is shown to have survived the onslaught and duels [[Éowyn]], who gains the upper hand and wounds his leg. Gothmog collapses in pain moments before the [[Witch-king]] arrives on the scene of the battle. Éowyn succeeds in destroying the Witch-king, but is injured in the process and crawls to [[Merry]].

At this point, Gothmog rises, furious for revenge, and uses an [[Weapons#Axes|axe]] for support as he limps towards her. As he approaches, he discards the axe and picks up a mace, preparing to kill Éowyn. [[Aragorn]] rushes in and chops off his arm, before [[Gimli]] strikes Gothmog from behind in the torso with his axe, and Aragorn then delivers the final blow to his back, killing him.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Gothmog.jpg|thumb|right|Eärnur as Gothmog in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]

Gothmog plays a major role in the game as the chief antagonist of several Epic storylines and is also combined with the character of [[Eärnur]]. In the game's version of events, in [[Minas Morgul]] Eärnur was transformed into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] named '''Mordirith''' in service of the [[Witch-king]], who in mockery of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] made Mordirith his own Steward of [[Carn Dûm]] in [[Angmar]]. Long abscent from it, Mordirith returns to Carn Dûm shortly before [[War of the Ring]], launching attacks against the Free Peoples of [[Eriador]]. Mordirith is defeated at the end of the game's original storyline, plunging the other servants of [[Sauron]] into a civil war over his position before he returns and his identity is revealed at the end of ''Volume I''.

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] Gothmog personally kills the Ranger [[Halbarad]], but when his master is undone and can no longer bring him back from the void, he suddenly feels fear again and flees the battlefield before [[Aragorn]]. Gothmog barricades himself inside Minas Morgul, refusing even Sauron's muster to the Black Gate. Though he outlives the Dark Lord's demise, his other surviving servants blame Gothmog for it and combine their forces to assault of the City of the Dead. This gives the players and a group of [[Rangers of Ithilien]] the opportunity to sneak inside and challenge Gothmog, delivering a final defeat to him.
