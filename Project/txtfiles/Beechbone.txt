'''Beechbone''' was one of the younger [[Ent|Ents]] who lived in [[Fangorn Forest]], said to be handsome and very tall.

== Biography ==
Little is known of Beechbone except that he took part in the [[Destruction of Isengard]] with the other Ents on [[March 3]], [[3019]]. In the chaos, he apparently burned to death after being set on fire by gas let out of the vents of [[Isengard]]. This further angered the other Ents, rousing them to finish destroying Isengard.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']], Book Three, Ch. IX: "[[Flotsam and Jetsam]]"</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptions ==
=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===
In [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Two Towers (film)|film adaptation]], an Ent presumed to be Beechbone is briefly seen being set on fire by Orcs using flaming arrows. He survives, however, by extinguishing himself in the [[Isen|flood]] caused by the dam being broken.
