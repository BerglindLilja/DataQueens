Born in [[Aldburg]], Léowyn wanted to become a [[Rohirrim]] warrior when she showed her skills with a light spear at an early age, but her father would not allow it. After the [[Battle of Helm's Deep|battle of]] [[Helm's Deep]], Léowyn attended the celebration at [[Meduseld]] where she and the attendants would honor the victims (both [[Men]] and [[Elves]]) that were killed while defending the Keep from [[Saruman]]'s [[Saruman's army|army]] of [[Uruk-hai]]. As [[Sauron]] was preparing to send his armies to attack [[Minas Tirith]], the capital of [[Gondor]], Léowyn, like [[Éowyn]], disguised herself as a soldier and rode to the relief of Minas Tirith. She fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], and was mostly likely slain.
