'''Glóin''' son of [[Gróin]] was one of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin II Oakenshield]]'s company who set out to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] in the [[Quest of Erebor]]''[[The Hobbit|.]]'' He was also the father of [[Gimli]], who became a member of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (group)|Fellowship of the Ring]].

Glóin chiefly appears in ''The Hobbit'' as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']]'' ''[[Council of Elrond|during]] the Fellowship's stay in [[Rivendell]].

== Biography ==
=== Early Life ===
Glóin was born in [[TA 2783]], after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of [[Gróin]] and younger brother of [[Óin]].

In [[TA 2799]], Glóin was known to have fought in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the last battle of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

In [[TA 2879]], in the [[Blue Mountains]], while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of [[TA 2941]] in [[Bree]], [[Thorin II Oakenshield|Thorin Oakenshield]] met by chance the wizard [[Gandalf the Grey]], pushing Thorin to reclaim [[Erebor]], so that [[Smaug]] wouldn't start an alliance with [[Sauron]]. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell". 

=== Quest for Erebor ===
In [[TA 2941]], Glóin and his brother [[Óin]], along with his cousins [[Dwalin]] and [[Balin]], were among the Dwarves accompanying [[Thorin and Company]] during their quest to the [[Lonely Mountain]] to recapture The Kingdom of [[Erebor (Soundtrack)|Erebor]] from the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]]. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the [[Battle of the Five Armies]].<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]''</ref> After the battle, he made his home in the Lonely Mountain.

=== War of the Ring ===

On [[October 25]], [[3018]], Glóin and his son [[Gimli]] attended the [[Council of Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]], where he greeted [[Frodo Baggins]] at the welcome dinner, after Frodo had recovered from his wounds received from the [[Witch-king of Angmar]]. He recounted the history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of [[Dale]] since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the Lonely Mountain and re-establish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in [[Moria]]. At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of the messengers from [[Mordor]] who had been threatening King [[Dáin II Ironfoot]], and seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the [[One Ring]]. It is unknown whether Glóin fought against [[Sauron]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Dale|Battle of Dale.]]

=== Later Life ===
Glóin died in [[FO 15]] at the age of 253.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix A]]: ''Annals of the Kings and Rulers,'' III: "Durin's Folk"</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== The Hobbit film (1977) ===
[[File:Rankin Bass Gloin.PNG|thumb|Gloin (1977)]]
In the animated version of The Hobbit, Glóin is shown near his brother, Óin. He fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and stood by Thorin's side;  he is voiced by [[wikipedia:Jack DeLeon|Jack DeLeon]]. 

=== The ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy ===

Glóin briefly appears in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as he and Gimli enter Rivendell; played in fact by [[John Rhys-Davies]], who also played Gimli.

=== ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy ===

In the film ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' (2012), Glóin is portrayed by [[Peter Hambleton]]. Glóin is seen wielding axes that look identical to those carried by his son Gimli in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films. The studio has released the following statement about the character in the upcoming films:

''"Of all the members in The Company of [[Dwarves]] who set out on the Quest to The Lonely Mountain, Glóin is the most outspoken and opinionated and is not afraid to challenge authority. He has a tendency to be quick-tempered, but he is also strong, brave, and loyal. Glóin is one of the only married Dwarves in the Company (there being a shortage of female Dwarves in general). His wife is an acclaimed beauty with a particularly fine beard. Glóin is also the proud father of a young son, Gimli, who will later grow up to become part of the famous Fellowship of the Ring."''

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', Glóin is captured by Mirkwood's Elvenguards right after encountering the spiders. [[Legolas]] confiscates and speaks insultingly about portraits of Glóin's wife and his young son Gimli. Later, the rest of the Company pressure Glóin to contribute his remaining money to help pay for having [[Bard]] smuggle them into [[Lake-town]]. He gives in when he sees how close they are to the Lonely Mountain.

=== Radio series ===

In The Hobbit (1968 radio series), he was voiced by Peter Baldwin.

=== Video games ===
*Along with the rest of Thorin's Company, Glóin appears in ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)]]''.

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' he and [[Glorfindel]] are leading a campaign in the north following the Fellowship's departure. In [[The Lord of the Rings Online]] Glóin and other Dwarves make a camp in the [[Misty Mountains]] above Rivendell and combat the threats found in the mountains, such as goblins and Wargs, determined to make passage between Rivendell and the Lonely Mountain safe once more.

[[File:Glóin - LOTRO.jpg|thumb|Glóin in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]
* In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Glóin's first chronological appearance is a cameo in a brief scene showing the departure of [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company from [[Ered Luin]]. He then appears in the [[Misty Mountains]] north of [[Rivendell]], where in late 3017 T.A. Glóin and a few other dwarves establish a camp to deal with the treats in the [[High Pass]] and the [[Goblin-town]]. He eventually returns to the [[Lonely Mountain]] and in 3018 T.A. after the [[Battle of Dale]] Gloin reunites with the other surviving members of Thorin's Company. Later that year [[Nori]] takes some on an expedition to [[Ered Mithrin]] against the orders of King [[Thorin III]] and Glóin and [[Bofur]] join [[Dori]] on a mission to rescue his brother from his own folly. The Dwarves travel through the Grey Mountains and eventually find Nori, but unlike the other Glóin does not immediately return to Erebor. Instead, he stays in the Grey Mountains where he becomes involved in Price [[Durin VII]]'s upcoming war against the [[orcs]] of [[Gundabad]]. On Durin's orders Glóin and some other dwarves track down a raiding party from Gundabad through the wellsprings of [[Anduin]], eventually travelling to the northernmost outposts of the [[Beornings]].

*Glóin was also one of the twelve starting Hero cards found in the ''Lord of The Rings Card Game'' starter set by Fantasy Flight Games. That version of him was the one closest related to the Glóin from the Fellowship of the Ring. His ability allowed him to take in more resource tokens at the expense of health.
