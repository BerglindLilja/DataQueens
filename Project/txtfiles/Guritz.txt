'''Guritz'''<ref>http://www.asmuslotr.com/guritz-2 Name verified</ref> was an [[Orc]] captain in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'' film who served [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

He does not appear in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s books.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy ===

Guritz had a large scar across his face that split his nose in two. He wore a helmet with a skull impaled on a spike, earning him the nickname '''Skully''' from the movie production crew, and the only weapon he was seen wielding was a two-handed scythe. He fled the charging [[Rohirrim]] and went with [[Murgash]] and a band of [[Orc]]s to the docks to mock the late-arriving Corsairs aboard theirÂ [[ship]]s. But the Corsairs were not on board; instead, Guritz and his company were met by [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], and the first wave of the [[Army of the Dead]]. When the Army of the Dead charged, Guritz tried to escape but fell backwards and was trampled by the charging army.
