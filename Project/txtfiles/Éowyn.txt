'''Éowyn''' was a shieldmaiden of [[Rohan]], daughter of [[Éomund]] and [[Théodwyn]], younger sister of [[Éomer]] and niece of King [[Théoden]]. After the [[War of the Ring]], she married [[Faramir]] and had one son with him, [[Elboron]].

==History==
[[File:Éowyn and Éomer.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|270x270px|Young Éomer and Éowyn, by Anna Lee]]
Éowyn was the second child of Éomund and Théodwyn. Like her brother Éomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's sister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in [[TA 3002]]. Afterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised them as his children.

'''War of the Ring'''

Prior to the [[War of the Ring]], Éowyn was forced to stay in [[Meduseld]] and care for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by the influence of [[Saruman]] and [[Gríma Wormtongue]]. When [[Gandalf]] restored the King, he prepared to defend Rohan against [[Isengard]]. Since Théoden planned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden [[Háma]], to suggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn, who, though a woman, was "fearless" and "all love[d] her".

Éowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to lead the people of [[Edoras]] to shelter in the [[White Mountains]], while [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]], Théoden, and the rest of the men confronted Saruman's army at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. When Aragorn passed through [[Dunharrow]] to take the [[Paths of the Dead]] she confessed her growing feelings for him, but already betrothed, he reluctantly refused her.

When [[Denethor II]] urgently [[Red Arrow|called for Théoden's aid]] against [[Mordor]], Éowyn again, begged to be allowed to ride to battle, but Théoden refused.

In bitterness, she disguised herself as a man, under the alias [[Dernhelm]], and rode to [[Minas Tirith]] on her horse [[Windfola]]. She took [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to battle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than a man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and Merry.<ref name="muster" />
[[File:Éowyn Vs. The Witch-king.jpg|alt=|thumb|260x260px|<span>Eowyn fighting the Witch King, by [http://moonxels.deviantart.com moonxels]</span>]]
During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his company were attacked by the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], lord of the [[Nazgûl]], she and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay mortally wounded, she challenged the Witch-King, who boasted that "no living man may hinder me". In answer, she removed her helmet, exposing her long blond hair, and declared, "''No living man am I! You look upon a woman! Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. Begone if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him!''".<ref name="pelennor" />

In a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she cleaved the head off his [[Witch-king's Fell Beast|Fell Beast]]. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace, breaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind with a [[Barrow-blades|Barrow-blade]] of [[Númenor|Westernesse]] make. Éowyn stabbed her sword through the Witch-king's head, killing him,<ref name="pelennor" /> and thus fulfilling [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy a thousand years earlier at the [[Battle of Fornost]] that "not by the hand of man" would the Witch-king fall.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]]: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (iv): "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"</ref>
[[File:Éowyn of Rohan - Screencap (3).jpg|alt=|thumb|270x270px|Éowyn at the Houses of Healing]]
Her constitution already severely weakened by her loneliness and despair, combined with her physical injuries, Éowyn succumbed to a severe case of the [[Black Breath]]. Théoden, not knowing that she was nearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been "dearer than daughter" to him.

Seeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother Éomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during the battle she was found by Prince [[Imrahil]], who noticed that she was still alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the [[Houses of Healing]]. There she was healed by Aragorn, the cure of the plant [[Athelas]], and the entreaties of her distraught brother.<ref name="houses">''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter VIII: "[[The Houses of Healing]]"</ref>
[[File:Éowyn of Rohan - Screencap (4).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|Éowyn and Faramir]]
Éowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched toward the [[Black Gate]], to challenge [[Sauron]]. She met and fell in love with [[Faramir]], who had likewise been injured before the battle. After the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of glory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.<ref name="houses" />

'''Later years'''

At Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He attended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan, where Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the [[Horn of Rohan]], a small silver horn taken from the hoard of [[Scatha]], the dragon.

Faramir and Éowyn settled in [[Ithilien]], where they had at least one son, [[Elboron]], and their grandson was [[Barahir]], who wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'' in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is nowhere recorded.

== Etymology==

'''''Éowyn''''' means "horse lover" in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] (the language Tolkien used to represent [[Rohirric]]).

The name was derived from an old Welsh name, ''Øwyn'' - slightly altered to sound like "A-O-win". The name in Welsh means "Horse friend", with the prefix ''Éo-'' meaning 'horse' and the suffix ''-wyn ''("whün") meaning 'friend.'

===Pronunciation===

The first syllable of Éowyn's name is pronounced "eh-ah," with the "ah" just barely pronounced. The second syllable pronounced is slightly different than it looks, however, being in Welsh it is pronounced "een;" the sound it makes together in an "Eh-awe-een," having the "w" barely pronounced at all, instead the word creates its own soft "w" without the voluntary sound, as in Welsh "w" is considered to be a vowel. As in [[wikipedia:Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]], the "y" in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter ''"ü"'' or the French "''u"''.

===Titles===

Éowyn's title was "'''Lady of Rohan'''" and was also known as "The White Lady of Rohan" due to her pale complexion. She also used the alias "'''Dernhelm'''" while riding with Rohan's army, and after her wounding by the Witch-king in the [[Pelennor Fields]] as "Lady of the Shield-arm".<ref name="pelennor" /> After her marriage to Faramir she was called the Lady of Ithilien (in contrast to Faramir, who was styled Prince of Ithilien), and '''Lady of Emyn Arnen'''.  
{{House of Eorl}}

==Behind the Scenes==

In [[w:William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[w:MacBeth (play)|Macbeth]]'', the title character believes he is invincible because the three Witch Sisters have prophesied that "no man of woman born" will defeat him. [[w:MacDuff|Macduff]], however, finds a loophole in this prophecy by declaring that he was "from his mother's womb untimely ripped" (which is usually interpreted to mean that he was delivered by [[w:Caesarian section|Caesarean section]]).

Éowyn and Merry, likewise, exploit a loophole in Glorfindel's prophecy, since she was a woman and Merry was a hobbit. Similar to Shakespeare's character Macbeth, the Witch-king was likely made overconfident by the prophecy, and unsettled by Éowyn's announcement that it did not apply to her.

==Earlier versions of the legendarium==

The character Éowyn had at first been the daughter of King Théoden. In another version, she had a cousin named [[Idis]], the daughter of the king, who was later removed in the manuscript as her role was eclipsed by Éowyn's.<ref name="treason">''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. VII: ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', chapter XXVI: "The King of the Golden Hall"</ref>

Éowyn was initially intended to marry [[Aragorn II]]. Tolkien considered that Aragorn loved Éowyn after her death, when she avenged the death of King Théoden. However, he later abandoned the concept, as he considered Aragorn to be "too old and lordly and grim".<ref name="treason" />

Éowyn was also once the twin-sister of [[Éomund]].<ref name="treason" />

== Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:Ralph Bakshi's Eowyn.PNG|thumb|Éowyn (1978)]]

=== Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings ===
Éowyn does appear in the 1978 animated film ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', which incorporates ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and the first half of ''The Two Towers'' (ending with the charge of the Rohirrim out of [[Helm's Deep]]), but does not have any spoken lines.
[[File:Rankin-Bass's Eowyn.PNG|thumb|205x205px|Éowyn (1980)]]

=== Rankin/Bass's Return of the King ===
In the 1980 animated film ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', Éowyn was voiced by [[wikipedia:Nellie Bellflower|Nellie Bellflower]]. Because the film was produced in isolation (without accompanying versions of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' or ''The Two Towers''), and hastily compresses the plot of the book, Éowyn does not appear in the film at all until the climactic moment on the Pelennor Fields when she reveals her identity to the Witch-king and attacks him.

=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===
[[File:Éowyn of Rohan - Screencap (2).jpg|alt=|thumb|191x191px|Éowyn in the [[New Line Cinema]] films]]In [[Peter Jackson]]'s film versions of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', Éowyn is portrayed by Australian actress [[Miranda Otto]]. The role was originally offered to actress Alison Doody, but Doody had to withdraw from the project due to pregnancy.
[[File:Éowyn of Rohan - Screencap (1).jpg|alt=|thumb|227x227px|[[Miranda Otto]] as Éowyn]]
The theatrical version of ''The Two Towers'' makes several changes and additions to Éowyn's role:

*[[Wormtongue]] approaches her over Theodred's deathbed, trying to win her affection, but she rebuffs him;
*Éowyn accompanies Theoden as he leads [[Edoras]]'s people to [[Helm's Deep]]; when the column was attacked by [[Warg]]-riders, she asks to fight, but Theoden orders her to lead the people on to the fortress. Along the way, she attempts to show her affection for Aragorn by serving him lunch and he gives an amusing reaction to her bad cooking.
*Éowyn watches over the women and children hiding in [[Aglarond]] while the [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle]] rages outside;
*Éowyn embraces Aragorn after the battle, thrilled to see him alive.

Several additional scenes are added in the extended version:

*While Edoras is being evacuated, Aragorn notices the Riders trying to restrain [[Brego (horse)|Brego]], and Éowyn "introduces" them to each other.
*While Aragorn and the other men are preparing to defend Helm's Deep, Éowyn protests that she has been assigned to wait in the caves instead of being allowed to fight on the walls; when Aragorn tries to comfort her, she blurts that the others who "love" him are being allowed to fight at his side (this reproduces dialogue from ''The Return of the King'', when she is pleading with him to let her ride with the [[Grey Company]] on the [[Paths of the Dead]]).
*In a short clip which appeared in the trailer, though not in either version of the finished film, Éowyn has a sword ready when a stray [[Uruk-hai]] enters the caves beneath Helm's Deep.

In the original theatrical release of ''The Return of the King'', Éowyn's injuries after fighting the Witch-king are less severe than in the novel; her arm is broken but she maintains consciousness after the Witch-king dies, and next appears at Aragorn's coronation in Minas Tirith, side by side with Faramir.

Several additional scenes are added in the extended edition:

* On the night after the Battle of Helm's Deep, she wakes up on her bed in Meduseld and tells Aragorn that she had a dream about the fall of [[Numenor]];
*At [[Dunharrow]], after she rebukes Éomer for making fun of Merry's desire to join in the fighting, he lectures her that war should be left to men;
*Before the army reaches Minas Tirith, she tells Merry to have courage, but Merry counsels her not to wish too much for death, as she has so much to live for;
*After the toppling [[Mumak]] unhorses Éowyn and Merry, they both fight on foot to defend Theoden from several attacking [[Orcs]] and [[Haradrim]]. Éowyn personally duels [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]], and inflicts a crippling leg wound on him.
* After the Witch-king dies, Éowyn crawls around looking for Merry, but is spotted by an enraged Gothmog, who crawls after her but is killed by [[Aragorn]] and [[Gimli]] before he can reach her;
*In the aftermath of the battle, Éomer finds her on the battlefield, unconscious and apparently dead, and grieves, but she recovers in the [[Houses of Healing]] and catches sight of [[Faramir]] for the first time;
*As the Army of the West marches out of Minas Tirith, Éowyn and Faramir watch them go, and he comforts her.
