'''Lindenroot''' was an elderly [[Ents|Ent]] who lived in the [[Fangorn Forest|forest of Fangorn]] during the past ages of [[Middle-earth]]. He was 2,000 years at the time of the [[Destruction of Isengard]].

== Biography ==
In [[TA 3019|3019]], Lindenroot was among the Ents that attended the [[Entmoot]], a gathering or meeting not commonly held. There, he and the Ents would discuss and come to the conclusion that the Ents must go to war against [[Saruman]]. Later, Lindenroot, along with many Ents, followed [[Treebeard]], [[Merry]], [[Pippin]] to [[Isengard]] since they were unhappy that Saruman and his forces were burning and cutting down their trees. He participated in and survived the Destruction of Isengard.
