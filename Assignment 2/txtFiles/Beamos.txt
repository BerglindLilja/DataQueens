{{Fi|Beamos|This is an ancient security mechanism. Its weak point is its eye. The eye is also a weapon that fires a focused energy beam.

I calculate a 100% failure rate at any attempt to strike the eye with your sword while it is still on top of the pedestal.

I recommend using a weapon that can strike at high targets, or conversely lowering its head to a height your sword can reach.}}

The Beamos is one of the most technologically advanced enemies in the ''Zelda'' universe. They appear as statues with rotating, glaring eyes capable of shooting beams of light at their foes, and are usually indestructible. They can appear as either statues of stone or of solid metal, however much like real statues, they are incapable of moving, and must rely on their laser solely to keep intruders at bay. For this reason, Beamos are often situated inside dungeon rooms, or placed strategically on a staircase or entrance to impede progress, using swiveling movements to check all of their bounds. This laser of theirs, in every incarnation, has a specified range that can be bested whenever [[Link]] steps out of range, hides behind an object, or in some games, simply when the Beamos is off the screen.

While the laser of the Beamos normally cannot be stopped once it has been shot, in some games, specifically in {{LA}} and {{SS}}, Link can use certain [[Shield]]s to reflect the laser away. However it most games, it must simply be avoided. For the majority of ''Zelda'' titles, the laser itself is a continuous long beam, except for {{ALttP}} and {{LA|-}}, where it is a single short beam.

Beamos across {{TLoZ|Series}} often only come in one variety, however, other variations do exist. In {{TWW}}, which distinguishes Beamos by color, red Beamos behave like ordinary Beamos, whereas the blue kind have fixed beam paths, and will block Link's path entirely until they are destroyed. In {{TP}}, there exists two varieties; a larger brown type in the [[Goron Mines]] and minor caves that are able to shoot fire beams, and a thinner white version in the [[Temple of Time (Dungeon)|Temple of Time]], which shoots pink beams of energy. The white variants can be destroyed by the statue Link controls with the [[Dominion Rod]].

In {{SS|-}}, Beamos appear as multi-layered poles composed of electrified sections. The head of the Beamos turns in a rigid, mechanical motion as opposed to moving fluently. The beams they shoot are electrified, which will cause Link more harm if he attempts to block it with an Iron Shield. As they are mechanical creations from the past, they are shown to have crumbled into a pile of stone after many years, but will be returned to life as do other enemies when under the effects of an activated [[Timeshift Stone]].

In many games, Beamos are indestructible and impervious to all attacks, requiring that Link avoid them entirely. However in a few games, particularly in the 3D console games, the Beamos statues can be destroyed or rendered inoperable. In {{OoT}} and {{MM}}, Beamos can be destroyed with the use of a [[Bomb]]. The entire statue is destroyed on impact and explodes as its eye hits the ground. In {{TWW|-}}, {{FSA}} and {{TP|-}}, an [[Arrow]] can be shot at its eye to destroy it. The [[Ball and Chain]] can also be used to destroy a Beamos Statue in {{TP|-}}. In {{LA|-}} for Nintendo Switch, the beams can be reflected back at the Beamos with the [[Mirror Shield]], temporarily disabling them.

Beamos in {{SS|-}} require a more unique means to defeat, achieved by slicing apart different sections of their body and stabbing the eye. However the [[Bow]] also becomes effective later in the game. They can be stunned by blocking their beams with a shield, with the exception of an Iron Shield. Using the [[Gust Bellows]] on the wing-like structures on the sides of its head will also cause it to become dizzy and stunned for a short time.

In {{TFH|-}}, Beamos have a slightly different appearance. Instead of a rotating tower, as in previous games, they are spherical in shape and sit atop stone pillars where they scan their surroundings and fire a laser beam when they spot one of the [[Links]]. They can only be reached by forming a [[Totem]], and can then be attacked by shooting Arrows at them. It takes a couple Arrow shots to defeat them, however if their eye is successfully shot as they rotate, they are instantly defeated. Once they have been defeated, they will roll towards the Links while flashing, and eventually explode. This behavior is very similar to Armos.

==Other Appearances==
{{Ambig|Start}}
==={{CoH|-}}===
Beamos appear as enemies in {{CoH}} where they move to the beat of the music. While their bodies are stationary, their single eye rotates around them on every single beat, lighting up for one music beat when spotting either {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}}, or {{Term|CoH|Princess Zelda|link}} when they pass by, and then firing a laser at them on the following beat. Their laser can fire in any direction, including diagonally, and also deal damage to enemies that accidentally walk into their line of fire. Beamos only possess 2 hearts.

==={{HW|-}}===
[[File:HW Beamos Render.png|right|100px]]
In {{HW}}, Beamos typically appear inside of [[Keep]]s, or rarely outside of them, in various Stages of the game. They shoot magical beams into the floor in a straight path which then explode sequentially. They are primarily susceptible to Bombs, as regular attacks are ineffective against them. Despite their weakness to Bombs, blasts from Bomb Flowers do not harm them.

Special Attacks are also capable of defeating Beamos, as Special Attacks are capable of bypassing an enemy's defense. This is evidenced by the fact that when using Focus Spirit, regular attacks break its "shield" and eventually are capable of defeating it. Powerful Focus Spirit attacks are also capable of defeating Beamos in the same manner.

==Trivia==
* In {{OoT|-}}, when targeting a Beamos, [[Navi]] says that it does not like smoke. This quote is similar to the [[Old Man]]'s hint in {{Term|TLoZ|Level 2|link}} in {{TLoZ}}, where he says that "[[Iconic Quotes from The Legend of Zelda#"Dodongo Dislikes Smoke"|Dodongo Dislikes Smoke]]."
* The Beamos, [[Dexivine]]s, [[Vines]], and [[Warship]]s in {{TWW|-}} are the only enemies in the game that cannot be made into a [[Nintendo Gallery]] [[Figurines in The Wind Waker|Figurine]]. Giving a picture of one to [[Carlov]] will result in him making an [[Armos]] Figurine.
