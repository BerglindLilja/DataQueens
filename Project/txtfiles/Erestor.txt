'''Erestor''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Rivendell]] and a chief of [[Elrond|Elrond's]] household.

== Biography ==

Erestor attended the [[Council of Elrond]] on [[October 25]], [[TA 3018|3018]]. During the discussion about what to do with the [[One Ring]], Erestor asked whether [[Tom Bombadil]] could be called upon to help, or whether the Ring could be sent to him for safe-keeping, but that option was rejected.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book Two, Ch. II: "[[The Council of Elrond (chapter)|The Council of Elrond]]"</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]], Erestor was among the party that accompanied [[Arwen]] to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding to [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]]. They arrived in the city on Midsummer's Eve of [[3019]]. It is not known whether Erestor left [[Middle-earth]] with Elrond in [[September]] of [[TA 3021|3021]], but it is most likely that he did leave eventually.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'','' [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter V: "[[The Steward and the King]]"</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'', it was said that "There were three counsellors of Elrond's own household: Erestor his kinsman (a man of the same half-elvish folk known as the children of [[Lúthien]]), and beside him two elflords of Rivendell."<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. VI: ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'', The Story Continued, chapter XXIII: "In the House of Elrond"</ref> In others, Erestor was continued to be referred as Elrond's kinsman and one of the [[Half-elven]]. He was at first considered one of the [[Nine Walkers]], called "Erestor Half-elf", and had the role later replaced by that of [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]].<ref>''The History of Middle-earth'', Vol. VI: ''The Return of the Shadow'', The Story Continued, chapter XXIV: "The Ring Goes South"</ref>[[File:Strategy Battle Game - Erestor.jpg|thumb|200px|Erestor as portrayed in the Strategy Battle Game]]
