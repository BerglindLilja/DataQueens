'''Rose Cotton''', nicknamed '''Rosie''', was a [[hobbit]] of the [[Shire]]. She wedded [[Samwise Gamgee]], renowned companion of [[Frodo Baggins]] in the [[Quest of the Ring|quest]] of the [[One Ring]]. She became the mother of Frodo Gardner, Elanor, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman (Tom).



== Biography ==

Rosie was a Cotton; the daughter of [[Farmer Cotton|Tolman Cotton]] and [[Lily Cotton|Lily Brown]], and the sister of [[Tolman Cotton Jr.|Tolman (Tom)]], [[Wilcome Cotton]] (Jolly), [[Bowman Cotton|Bowman (Nick)]], and [[Carl Cotton]] (Nibs), and wife of [[Samwise Gamgee]]. She lived with her family on [[South Lane]], in a farm near [[Bywater]]. Her early life is not well recorded but it is known that she and her family were always close to the [[Gamgee]]s, and her brothers frequently swam in the [[Bywater Pool]] as youths with the Gamgees including Sam.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter III: "[[Mount Doom (chapter)|Mount Doom]]"</ref> Being very close friends with Sam, she expected that she and him would eventually marry, and expecting a marriage proposal soon she didn't like it when she heard Sam had left the [[Shire]], apparently for [[Crickhollow]]. Though not pleased that he was away for a year, she waited for him patiently.<ref name=Scouring>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref>

=== War of the Ring ===

Rosie and her family were just as angry as most everyone else but remained docile due to having a family to look after. Rosie remained protected. When Sam came back on [[November 2]], [[3019]], she told him that she had expected him by the spring and thought him dead. She eventually helped him and the other returning hobbits [[Scouring of the Shire|fight]] and [[Battle of Bywater|defeat]] the [[Ruffians]] and Sharkey. During this time, Sam got the chance to tell her where he had really been and what he had really been doing for over a year. After the war, Sam and [[Frodo]] lived with Rosie and the Cottons for a time until [[Bag End]] was restored to livable conditions.

Sam and Rosie were finally married on [[May 1]], [[TA 3020|3020]] and moved to Bag End.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter IX: "[[The Grey Havens]]"</ref><ref name="Appendix">''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands)</ref>. Sam and Rosie had thirteen children: [[Elanor Gamgee|Elanor]], [[Frodo Gamgee|Frodo]], Rose, [[Merry]], [[Pippin]], [[Goldilocks (Gardner) Took|Goldilocks]], [[Hamfast Gamgee|Hamfast]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[Primrose Gamgee|Primrose]], [[Bilbo Gamgee|Bilbo]], [[Ruby Gamgee|Ruby]], [[Robin Gamgee|Robin]], [[Tolman Gamgee|Tolman (Tom)]]. Many were named after Sam and Rosie's friends and relatives. Among them were Elanor the Fair, Frodo Gardner, and [[Goldilocks (Gardner) Took|Goldilocks]].<ref name="Scouring">''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter VIII: "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref>

=== Fourth Age ===

In their later years, Sam and Rosie went to [[Gondor]] and lived there for over one year in the house of [[King of the Reunited Kingdom|King]] [[Aragorn II Elessar]]. When they returned, they lived out their lives seeing Sam's [[Mayor of the Shire|mayoral]] duties passed to [[Tolman Cotton Jr.]]. Rosie died in the year [[FO 61|61]] in [[Mid-year's Day]] at the age of ninety-eight. Sam then left [[Middle-earth]] for the [[Undying Lands]] later that year after giving their daughter the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]''.<ref name="Appendix">''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands)</ref>

== Behind the scenes ==

:"''I think the simple 'rustic' love of Sam and his Rosie (nowhere elaborated) is absolutely essential to the study of his (the chief hero's) character, and to the theme of the relation of ordinary life (breathing, eating, working, begetting) and quests, sacrifice, causes, and the 'longing for Elves', and sheer beauty.''" - [[J.R.R Tolkien]] letter dated 1951.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== Rankin/Bass film ===

In ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)]]'', Rosie was not voiced by anyone but was seen as a blonde woman in a dream that Sam had when he put on the [[One Ring|Ring]]. (''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'')

=== BBC Radio play ===

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)]]'', Rosie was voiced by [[Kathryn Hurlbutt]]. (''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)]]'')

=== Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy ===

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s Film Trilogy, Rosie lives at 10 [[Bagshot Row]] and is played by [[Sarah McLeod]] and was employed as a barmaid. She barely speaks at all, but dances at Bilbo's party, eagerly taking Sam in her arms as he is encouraged to participate by Frodo. (''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'')
