{{Quote|A tall and evil shape, mounted upon a black horse… The rider was robed all in black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no Ringwraith but a living man ... his name is remembered in no tale, for he himself had forgotten it.|''The Return of the King''}}

The '''Mouth of Sauron''' was one of [[Sauron]]'s most devoted servants, serving as his herald and messenger, and as the Lieutenant of the Tower of [[Barad-dûr]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. His true name was forgotten, even by himself.

== HistoryNa ==
The Mouth of Sauron was a man, whose early history is unknown. He was one of the [[Black Númenóreans]], Men who established their dwellings in [[Middle-earth]] during the years of Sauron's domination and worshipped him. The Mouth of Sauron entered the service of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] when it rose again. He learned sorcery, rose to become the Lieutenant of [[Barad-dûr]], and commanded the Orc armies of [[Gorgoroth|Gorgoroth.]] He was one of the few servants of Mordor who communicated directly with Sauron.

=== War of the Ring ===

The Mouth of Sauron appeared briefly before the host of the West prior to the [[Battle of the Black Gate|Battle of the ]]Morannon. He dismissed [[Aragorn]]'s claim as king, and demanded to know who had authority to treat with him. But then Aragorn's gaze frightened him, and he cried out that he was an ambassador, and not to be attacked. [[Gandalf]] assured him he would not be, so the Mouth took Gandalf to be the delegate. He showed them Sam's sword, a grey cloak with an Elven-brooch, and [[Frodo]]'s [[Bilbo's Mithril shirt|mithril-vest]], and said that the fate of the "spy" would depend on their actions, further insinuating that if they did not comply, the "spy" would be tortured for many years.

The Mouth then stated that the Hobbit would be allowed to go free, so long as the captains agreed to Sauron's terms: that the "rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies" withdraw beyond the [[Anduin]] River, swearing oaths "never again to assail Sauron the Great in arms, open or secret"; all lands east of the Anduin River would belong to Sauron in perpetuity, and all lands West up to the [[Gap of Rohan]] would be disarmed and pay tribute to Mordor. Sauron would allow them to govern their own affairs so long as they helped to rebuild [[Isengard]], which would be then ruled by a master more reliable than [[Saruman]] (presumably the Mouth himself).

Gandalf replied that was too much for the ransom of one servant, and doubted that Sauron would keep his word, calling him the "Base Master of treachery."[1] Gandalf demanded that the prisoner be brought forth, but the Mouth only responded, "These are the terms. Take them or leave them!" Gandalf responded, "These we will take!", seized the cloak, sword, and Mithril coat, utterly rejecting Sauron's terms and ordered the Mouth to be gone, as they had not come to bargain with Sauron, much less with one of his slaves. Enraged and fearful at the same time, the Mouth fled back to the Gate and set Mordor's forces upon the West.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]], Book Five, Ch. X: "[[The Black Gate Opens]]"''</ref>

[[File:The_mouth_of_sauron_25-1-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Mouth of Sauron confronting [[Gandalf]], in the  Extended Edition of the film]]

== Age ==

It is uncertain to which event is referred by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] denoting when the Mouth of Sauron entered Sauron's service. The dark tower first rose shortly after [[SA 3320]], and was rebuilt later when Sauron openly proclaimed himself in [[TA 2951]]. The former option would indicate the Mouth is thousands of years old by the time of the War of the Ring, implying his life was extended through sorcery. However, it remains unknown how old he was at the time of Sauron's final defeat.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===
{{Quote|My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.|Mouth of Sauron addressing the Captains of the West at the Black Gate}}
In the [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] movie adaptation of [[The Return of the King (movie)|<nowiki>''The Return of the King''</nowiki>]], scenes with the Mouth of Sauron were filmed but cut from the original theatrical release. These scenes were later put back into the film in the extended edition. In the film, the Mouth of Sauron is decapitated by [[Aragorn]], while he leaves back to the Gate and is never seen again in the books. He was played by [[Bruce Spence]] and appears as a tall, monstrous Man wearing black, priest-like robes and a helm that bears the words "Lammen Gorthaur" ([[Sindarin]] for "Voice of the Dread Abomination") written in [[Cirth]] runes. This helmet covers most of his face with only his horribly disfigured and diseased mouth visible. His mouth was digitally increased in size for a more unsettling and memorable appearance.

The Mouth of Sauron's cracked, blackened lips and rotting teeth were added as a hint that Sauron's very words are so evil that simply repeating them causes the speaker's mouth to decay and bleed. This change was made digitally, long after the footage had been shot. After Jackson rejected the idea of turning the mouth sideways to appear vertical on the face, the designers came up with the idea of rendering it twice as large as the original. According to designer [[Warren Mahy]], the original design for the Mouth of Sauron's costume had the helmet hooked directly into the mouth, pulling it permanently open. This had to be discarded, as it made it impossible for the actor to speak. However, Peter Jackson liked the idea of the robe flowing up into the helmet and this was retained for the final version.

=== Rankin-Bass animated film ===

[[File:Rotk-2-3242-mouth-sauron.jpg|thumb|200px|The animated version of the Mouth of Sauron, as depicted in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]]]

{{Quote|The [[Frodo Baggins|halfling]] was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would have thought that one so small would endure so much pain?|Mouth of Sauron, lying about Frodo's death, from The Return of the King film.}}
He appears briefly in the [[Rankin-Bass]] animated film [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'']], in a shortened version of his scene from the novel. After he introduces himself, he mocks Aragorn and warns him that he is "hopelessly outnumbered", however Aragorn rebuffs him with no help from Gandalf.

He was portrayed by [[Don Messick]], who also voiced [[King Theoden]] and the [[Easterling]] captain in the movie.

=== Radio versions ===

He appears in both the radio programs done by the Mind's Eye and the [[BBC]] in 1979 and 1981, where he is voiced by [[wikipedia:John Vickery|John Vickery]] and John Rye. In the BBC's version, the Mouth is given an extended role and is the one who tortures Gollum into telling him why he came there and what he was looking for.

In the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|Return of the King ]]''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|video game]], the Mouth of Sauron is a boss in the level "The Black Gate". [[Aragorn]] duels with him and slays him before the host of [[Mordor]] arrives. The same occurs in [[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest|''The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest'']], but near the battle's end four orcs/goblins aid him.

In the [[Middle-earth Role Playing|Middle-earth Role Playing game]], the Mouth of Sauron is named Urzahil, though this name was not created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

=== Video games ===
==== LOTR: The Return of the King ====
He appears as the first thing you fight in the battle of the Black Gate.

==== The Battle for Middle-earth II ====

In the computer game ''[[The Battle for Middle-Earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', the Mouth of Sauron was also the Lord of [[Dol Guldur]]. He is the primary Mordor commander in the conquest of Northern Middle-earth, who carries out his master's orders brutally and efficiently, conquering many Elven and Dwarven realms with ease.

'''Lothlórien, Mission 1'''

[[File:Battle-for-middle-earth-ii-the-mouth-of-sauron-approaches-lorien.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Mouth of Sauron leads his forces to Lothlórien.]]

The Mouth of Sauron travels (apparently from Dol Guldur) with three [[Nazgûl]], to meet with Goblin forces in the outskirts of Lorien. From there, they build a mighty Goblin army by creating Goblin Caves and Fissures. From these wretched places emerge numerous warriors, archers, and Cave Trolls. The Mouth and the Nazgûl lead this mighty army to inner Lorien, where they destroy the Elven structures and kill all in their path, slaying [[Haldir]] during the first part of the assault. While invading Lothlórien, the Mouth orders his Goblins to release Mountain Giants trapped by the Elves, providing additional reinforcements. At the very heart of Lorien, the Goblins assault the mighty structures and their defenders. [[Galadriel]] manages to escape the assault, but [[Celeborn]] is killed.

The Goblins finish the job by destroying Lorien's massive Tree Palace, where Galadriel and Celeborn lived, signalling the complete Fall of Lorien. Galadriel is seen fleeing while the Mouth and his Goblins celebrate triumphantly. The Mouth then looks into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]], eagerly viewing and planning the next stages of his conquest of the North.

'''Mirkw​ood, Mission 5'''

In Mission 5, the Mouth of Sauron and three Nazgûl prepare building their base deep in the heart of Mirkwood. This time they have brought Shelob along in order to conquer the Elven part of Mirkwood. By creating Orc Pits, Troll Cages, and Taverns, they muster a mighty army of Orcs, Trolls, and [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. After preparing this great army, they begin to march upon Mirkwood by a great bridge. Unfortunately for the army of Mordor, the bridge is destroyed by Ents, and the host is forced to cross using an alternate route. Once making it to the other side, the Orcs and Corsairs use their Fire Arrows and Firebombs to destroy the Ents and incinerate their Ent Moots, eradicating them from Mirkwood permanently. Soon after recruiting more Spiderlings with the help of Shelob, the Mordor host comes upon the Old Forest Road. The Mordor forces immediately begin creating four sentry towers at key locations, but the Elves have plans of their own and begin attacking the forces of Mordor, building their own battle towers to reclaim the road. However, in spite of heavy resistance from the Elves, Mordor slays the enemy battalions, and conquers the Road, before the Mouth of Sauron and his forces move to [[Thranduil]]'s kingdom and lay waste to the mighty fortress.

The Elven buildings in Mirkwood are utterly destroyed, and the few survivors quickly flee to Rivendell to gather for the final attack. With Thranduil and his forces out of the way, the Mouth of Sauron conquers the rest of Mirkwood with ease, covering it in shadow.

'''Withered Heath, Mission 6'''

[[File:6842_the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii-mouth-of-sauron-and-the-nasghuls.jpg|thumb|260px|The Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl in Withered Heath]]

In Mission 6, the Mouth is sent to destroy the Dwarven outposts in the [[Withered Heath]], release many young Fire drakes into the service of Mordor, and recruit [[Drogoth the Dragon Lord]] as an ally to Sauron. To facilitate Mordor's conquest, the Mouth commands his troops to destroy the Dwarven tunnels, impeding transportation between the Dwarves. They also either ally themselves with or destroy various [[Warg]] lairs throughout the Withered Heath, for additional forces and money respectively. After all the Fire drakes have been released, the Mouth then seeks out Drogoth. The host of Mordor marches upon the northern path to the Dragon Lord, slaying any Men of Dale that attempt to stop them. The Mouth then communicates with Drogoth, and they make a treaty.

The Dragons are now allies with Sauron, a powerful force that will significantly hasten the downfall of the North.

'''Erebor, Mission 7'''

In Mission 7, a small strike force prepares an assault upon the city of [[Dale]], slaying the Dwarves and destroying many buildings. They claim the treasure within, which greatly assists the forces of Mordor. The Mouth successfully calls a [[Dragon]] to help them in their assault, and with a new fortress and the creation of a vast army, the Mouth and his host lay waste to the entire city of Dale, killing everyone in their path. [[Gloin]] attempts to stop the attack with a small force, but they are destroyed almost immediately. The Mouth  then turns his attention to the front gate of the Lonely Mountain, destroying it with aid from the Dragon, Attack Trolls, and Catapults. [[Dain II Ironfoot|King Dain]] musters the last Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain to hold out against this attack, but all are destroyed. To completely conquer the Lonely Mountain, the Mouth of Sauron attacks the Throne of the Lonely Mountain until it is destroyed. The Lonely Mountain has now fallen.

[[File:Mouth_of_Sauron_bfme2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Mouth of Sauron]]

The Dwarves have now been driven out of Erebor as they were from Moria. Only one safe haven remains for the free peoples of Middle-earth: [[Rivendell]].

'''Rivendell, Mission 8'''

There is only one task left for Sauron in order to completely take over the North: Rivendell must be destroyed, and Elrond and Arwen slain. The Mouth (with three [[Nazgûl]]) does not appear until the Goblins (led by [[Gorkil the Goblin King|King Gorkil]]) destroy Rivendell's outer defense buildings and gate. Then the Mouth brings a small army of Easterlings and some builders to establish a base there. 

During this, the [[Witch-King of Angmar]], [[Shelob]], [[Drogoth the Dragon Lord|Drogoth]], and [[Fell beast|Fell Beast riders]] arrive, followed by Sauron himself, who had killed Frodo and recovered the Ring. The Mouth then becomes one of Sauron's generals. However, the Fellowship of the Ring (besides Frodo and Sam, who are undoubtedly dead) arrives with the [[Army of the Dead]]. After this army disappears, Sauron and his army destroy the Fellowship, and Mordor's armies attack Rivendell. Elrond and Arwen attempt to stop them, but both are slain. The Mouth takes part in the destruction of two fortresses and Elrond's House, and Rivendell is defeated permanently.

Middle-earth is now veiled in darkness forever, and in the North, Sauron reigns supreme.

==== Good Campaign ====
In the Good Campaign, the Mouth leads a small Mordor army consisting of orcs, two Attack Trolls, and a few Ringwraiths into the Eastern entrance. However, Dwarven phalanx battalions and Men of Dale anticipate the attack, and the Mouth and his retinue are slain. The Mordor host attacking Erebor quickly joins them in defeat.

==== The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age ====

In "[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA)]]" game, the Mouth of Sauron is one of three Evil commanders that the player can choose for the duration of the game. In this game, the Mouth of Sauron provides a decent number of Command Points (1-3, plus Intimidate and Spoils of War). In addition, with all of his upgrades, he is a devastating warrior with base 10 damage, which is higher than any other hero except for Sauron himself. In essence, the Mouth of Sauron specializes in wiping out the enemy, whether he or his forces do it.

In the Good campaign, he appears as the enemy commander in two missions: The Black Gate Opens, in keeping with his appearance in ''The Return of the King'', and the Conquest of Osgiliath, in which the forces of Gondor under Boromir and Faramir retake the city.

==== The Lord of the Rings: Conquest ====

The Mouth of [[Sauron]] is a mage-type hero in this Battlefront style game. He is in the good campaign and is playable in the evil campaign and skirmish modes. His primary weapon is [[Saruman]]'s Staff of Orthanc, rather than a sword,. It is unknown whether he  had a copy with the same power made for him or received the original staff as a reward from Sauron. Possibly, the staff signifies that the Mouth is the new master of Isengard, since, in the "Proposal of Sauron", the Mouth says that "[Isengard] shall be Sauron's, and there his lieutenant shall dwell: not Saruman, but one more worthy of trust" and the heroes understand that the Mouth of Sauron would be the new master. 

In either case, the Mouth uses the staff's power to its fullest extent, devastating his enemies with it. In melee, unlike other mages, the Mouth uses his staff to rapidly hit his opponents many times with high speed and power. This "Barad-dûr Fury" takes the place of the ShockWave. The Mouth is also able to briefly summon orc servants one at a time to release a single blow on any enemy. (see: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]])''

==== Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest ====

The Mouth of Sauron appears as the penultimate boss (with Sauron's army being the final boss) in the Wii and PlayStation 3 version of ''Aragorn's Quest. ''The player must fight him one-on-one, at the start of the last level, "The Black Gate".

In the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS versions, he is the final boss, and can unleash fireballs at Aragorn.

====''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''====
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mouth of Sauron.jpg|thumb|The Mouth of Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
The Mouth of Sauron is one of the Gúrzyul, mortal servants of [[Sauron]] whom he made ageless through dark arts during the [[Second Age|Second Age.]] Unlike [[wraiths]], however, they remain bound to their physical bodies and can be killed. The Mouth of Sauron first appears at the [[Black Gate]] in a sequence nearly identical to that of the book. Here, he survives the demise of his master and names himself Dulgabêth, the Black Word, Sauron's Heir. He sends an emissary to treat with King [[Elessar]], offering to recognize the latter's sovereignty in exchange for being allowed to rule what is left of [[Mordor]]. Though his offer is absolutely rejected, the fact that it was made at all shows that the power of "Sauron's Heir" is far from absolute, and indeed he is revealed to be vying with the other Gúrzyul for power. Their internal strife allows the army of [[Gondor]] to advance into the Black Land, by which point the various "Masters of Mordor" realize the threat and seek to unite their forces. The Mouth of Sauron proposed to wed Lhaereth the Stained, Sauron's chief poisoner, responsible for the [[Great Plague|Great Plague.]] But she betrays him for allowing her beloved Lord Sauron to fail, poisoning the Mouth of Sauron in front of other Masters of Mordor, and proclaiming herself the one to carry on the legacy of Sauron. The others recognize her superiority, while the Mouth of Sauron is made into a blighted thrall and later killed by the player with the help of two Rangers.

====''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]''====
In the Lord of the Rings: Tactics, Mouth of Sauron appears in the Black Gate mission, who is using a sword in combat and a bow at range.
