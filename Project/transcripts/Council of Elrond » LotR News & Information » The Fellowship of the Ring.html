<b><u>TEXT: THE LORD OF THE RINGS </u></b><u></u></p>
<p>
It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.</p>
<p>In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others. And into this Ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.</p>
<p><i>(Sauron stands inside Mount Doom)</i></p>
<p>“One Ring to rule them all.”</p>
<p><i>(Wild men attack villages)</i></p>
<p>One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(An army of Elves and Men are seen on the field of Dagorlad)</i> A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. </p>
<p><i>(Armies of orcs attack the Elves and Men, who fight back bravely.)</i></p>
<p>Victory was near. But the power of the Ring could not be undone.</p>
<p><i>(Sauron steps onto the battlefield, carrying a mace and the Ring of Power on his finger. Everyone turns and looks at him with fear in their eyes. He swings his mace, sending a group of Elves flying through the air. Elendil raises his sword to strike, but Sauron flings him against a rock, crushing him to death. Shocked, Isildur runs over to his fallen father. Suddenly, he is aware of someone behind him, he rolls over, seeing Sauron towering above him)</i></p>
<p>It was in this moment when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father’s sword.</p>
<p><i>(Isildur grabs the hilt of Narsil, but Sauron stomps on it, shattering the blade. Sauron reaches down towards Isildur with the hand carrying the Ring. With a desperate attempt, Isildur lets out a cry and strikes Sauron’s hand with the shards of Narsil, slicing off the finger bearing the One Ring. Sauron let’s out a cry. He implodes, sending a shockwave throughout the battlefield, knocking the warriors off their feet. His armour falls to the ground, his body gone. Smoke emerges from within the armour) </i></p>
<p>Sauron, the enemy of the free-peoples of Middle-Earth was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. </p>
<p><i>(Isildur slowly reaches for the remains of Sauron’s finger bearing the Ring. The finger turns to ash in his hands, but the Ring shimmers faintly) </i></p>
<p>But the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. </p>
<p><i>(Isildur is riding trough the forest with a group of warriors, when ambushed by orcs.) </i></p>
<p>It betrayed Isildur to his death… </p>
<p><i>(Isildur floats down Anduin face down in the water, dead, with three arrows in his back. The Ring sinks into the depths of the river) </i></p>
<p>And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. </p>
<p>History became legend, legend became myth and for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. </p>
<p><b>Gollum:</b> My Precioussssssss </p>
<p>The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there, it consumed him. </p>
<p><i>(The Misty Mountains are shown, Gollum sits on a stone above a little pool inside the mountains)</i></p>
<p><b>Gollum:</b> It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my prrrecioussssss!</p>
<p>The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forest of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the east, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived. Its time had now come.<br>
It abandoned Gollum.</p>
<p><i>(the Ring falls down on the rocks, landing in a pile of sand)</i></p>
<p>But something happened then the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. </p>
<p><i>(A young Bilbo appears, picking up the Ring from the sand)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>What’s this?</p>
<p>A Hobbit: Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>A ring.</p>
<p><b>Gollum: </b><i>(from far away) </i>Lossssst! My precious is lost!<br>
<i>(Bilbo, alarmed, puts the Ring in his pocket)</i></p>
<p>For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.</p>

<p><i>(Frodo sits beneath a tree, reading a book. Suddenly, he hears someone singing and looks up. He smiles as he understands who it is. Gandalf drives his carriage through the fields while he sings)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>The road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow if I can… </p>
<p><i>(Frodo runs towards the grassy road)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> You’re late!</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf stops the carriage)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf: </b>A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. </p>
<p><i>(He looks at Frodo with a strict look that softens until they both laugh. Frodo jumps onto the carriage and into Gandalf’s arms)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Frodo:</b> Its wonderful to see you Gandalf!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Ooh! You didn’t think I’d miss your Uncle Bilbo’s birthday?</p>
<p><i>(Frodo sits besides Gandalf in the carriage as they drive through Hobbiton)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Frodo: </b>What news of the outside world? Tell me everything.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Everything? Far too eager and curious for a hobbit, most unnatural. Well what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past age, full of its own comings and goings. Scarcely aware of the existence of hobbits… which I am very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Hobbit folk:</b> Look it’s Gandalf! It’s Gandalf!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Gandalf drives the carriage past the party field, where Hobbits are getting the banner up)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Ohh! The long expected party!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(he starts smoking his pipe)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> So how is the old rascal? I hear it’s going to be a party of special magnificence.</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> You know Bilbo, he’s got the whole place in an uproar.<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf:</b> Hmmm, well now that should please him, hmmm.</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Half the Shire’s been invited.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Good gracious me! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> He is up to something. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Oh really.. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> All right then keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Indeed?</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> If you’re referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Whatever you did, you’ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Oh really? </p>
<p><i>(They drive past a hobbit hole with a grumpy hobbit working in the garden. He looks at Gandalf, turning even more grumpy)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbit children:</b> Gandalf! Gandalf! </p>
<p><i>(Some hobbit children run down the grassy hills towards the carriage)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbit children:</b> Fireworks?!? Gandalf?!?</p>
<p><i>(They look at him in disappointment as he drives along, pretending not to notice them)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbit children: </b>Awwwww.</p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, a blast of fireworks goes off from the carriage. The hobbit children clap their hands and cheer. The grumpy hobbit man laughs, a grumpy hobbit woman comes out and gives him a disapproving look and he gets the sour look on his face again. Gandalf chuckles)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Gandalf, I’m glad you’re back.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>So am I, dear boy! So am I.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo jumps of the carriage and waves at Gandalf. Gandalf drives up to Bag End and stops in front of the gate. He walks up to the door and knocks it with his staff. A voice is heard from inside)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>No thank you! We don’t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>And what about very old friends? </p>
<p><i>(Door opens and Bilbo stares at Gandalf in disbelief)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Gandalf? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Bilbo Baggins! </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> My dear Gandalf! </p>
<p><i>(They give each other a big hug)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Good to see you! One hundred and eleven years old –who would believe it? You haven’t aged a day.</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo runs inside, holding the door open for Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome! </p>
<p><i>(He takes Gandalf’s hat and staff)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger? I’ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296 –very good year. Almost as old as I am! Hahaha! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Just tea, thank you.</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo runs around the hobbit hole, Gandalf backs into a the chandelier, then turns and bumps his head onto the beam. He rubs his forehead and walks into Bilbo’s study. He looks at the papers on the desk, a map of The Lonely Mountain among them) </i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>I was expecting you here last week! Not that it matters, you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared, I’m afraid. We have some cold chicken and pickles… Here’s some cheese here- oh no it won’t do. There we got raspberry jam and apple tart… Not much for afterlunch – oh no! We’re all right. I have some cake. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(enters the study, looking for Gandalf, who has left) </i>I can make you some eggs if you like- oh. Gandalf? </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf peers into the study from the kitchen)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Just tea, thank you. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Ah right. You don’t mind if I eat, do you? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Oh no, not at all. </p>
<p><i>(A sharp knock on the door and a woman’s voice is heard)</i></p>
<p><b>Lobelia: </b>“Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!”</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo throws himself towards the wall, hiding. Then he turns to Gandalf, whispering)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> I’m not at home! </p>
<p><i>(He walks into the kitchen, looking out the little round window)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>I’ve got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell–they never give me a moment’s peace! I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo takes the tea off the fire with a towel.)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf:</b> So, you mean to go through with your plan, then. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Yes, yes. It’s all in hand. All the arrangements are made. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(Gandalf opens the lid on the pot) </i>Oh, thank you. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Frodo suspects something. <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Bilbo:</b> ‘Course he does. He’s a Baggins! Not some block-headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> You will tell him, won’t you? </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Yes, yes. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> He’s very fond of you. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>I know. He’d probably come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart Frodo is still in love with the Shire: the woods, the fields…little rivers. I’m old Gandalf. I know I don’t look it, but I’m beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin…sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday, and I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf and Bilbo sit outside Bag End, each with a pipe in his mouth)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo blows a ring of smoke. Gandalf smiles and blows a ship of smoke, sailing trough the smoke ring that Bilbo made)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Gandalf, my old friend. This will be a night to remember! </p>
<p><i>(A huge firework explodes onto the party field below. A lot of hobbits dance, eat, drink and talk with each other)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Hello, hello, Fatty Bolger, lovely to see you! Welcome, welcome!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo is dancing, and so is Rosie. Sam is watching from his seat. Frodo sits down beside him)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Go on Sam! Ask Rosie for a dance.</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>I think I’ll just have another ale. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Oh no you don’t. Go on. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo pushes Sam onto the dancefloor and into Rosie’s arms. He laughs at Sam’s attempt on dancing. Gandalf lets another set of fireworks off)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Whoa! </p>
<p><i>(Bilbo is sitting in front of a group of hobbit children, telling a story)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> So there I was, at the mercy of three monstrous trolls! And they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us, whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf is dancing together with the hobbits</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> They spent so much time arguing the wither-tos and why-fors, that when the sun’s first light cracked over the top of the trees and poof!<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Hobbit Children:</b> <i>(gasps)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>And turned them all to stone!</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf gets some more fireworks from his carriage. Merry and Pippin come forth from behind a tent. They stop beside the carriage)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Quickly! </p>
<p><i>(Merry helps Pippin onto the carriage. He starts searching for fireworks)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Whoa! Up they go. </p>
<p><i>(Pippin shows a firework to Merry)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> No, no the big one, big one </p>
<p><i>(Pippin finds one shaped as a large dragon. Merry gasps and nods. Pippin jumps down from the carriage, and into the tent beside it. Merry follows. Inside the tent, they light up the firework)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Done.</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> You’re supposed to stick it in the ground! </p>
<p><i>(Merry pushes the firework onto Pippin)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> It is in the ground. </p>
<p><i>(Pippin pushes it to Merry)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Outside! </p>
<p><i>(Merry pushes it back to Pippin)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>It was your idea!</p>
<p><i>(The firework flies off, everyone around turn towards it)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbit:</b> Look at that!</p>
<p><i>(The firework turns into a dragon, and it flies down towards the party field. The hobbits run away in fright, screaming)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Bilbo? Bilbo, look out for the dragon! </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Dragon? Nonsense! There hasn’t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years…</p>
<p><i>(Frodo pulls Bilbo to the ground, the dragon flies over them, barely making it over the field, before exploding into a mass of colors. The hobbits cheer and clap, Merry and Pippin are stunned)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>That was good!</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Let’s get another one! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf grabs them each by their ear)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry and Pippin:</b> Aah!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might’ve known. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf sits with his pipe, watching Merry and Pippin doing the dishes)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbits:</b> Speech, Bilbo! Speech! <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Frodo:</b> Speech! </p>
<p><i>(Bilbo steps up on a barrel under the great tree)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>My dear Bagginses and Boffins, Tooks and Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots. </p>
<p><b>Proudfoot Hobbit:</b> Proudfeet!</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo shakes him off, everyone laughs)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Proudfoots.</p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Today is my 111th birthday! </p>
<p><b>Hobbits: </b>Happy birthday! </p>
<p><b>Hobbit:</b> Happy birthday! </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like, and<br>
I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. </p>
<p><i>(The hobbits seem to not know how to take what Bilbo just said. He pulls the ring out of his pocket and fingers it behind his back. Gandalf watches closely, suspecting something)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> I, uh, I h-have things to do. <i>(whispers to himself) </i>I’ve put this off for far too long. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(To the crowd) </i>I regret to announce this is the end. I am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. </p>
<p><i>(He puts on the Ring and disappears)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbits: </b>Ohh! </p>
<p><i>(There is a big commotion among the hobbits as they look around and whisper to each other. The door at Bag End is opened, and once inside, Bilbo takes off the Ring, becoming visible. He walks into his study, laughing) </i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Hahahahaha! </p>
<p><i>(Flips the Ring in the air, then puts it back in his pocket. Walks over and grabs his walking stick. Suddenly, Gandalf is seen in a corner)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> I suppose you think that was terribly clever.</p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Come on Gandalf! Did you see their faces? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>There are many magic rings in this world Bilbo Baggins and none of them should be used lightly. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> It was just a bit of fun! Oh you’re probably right, as usual. You will keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you? </p>
<p><i>(Bilbo packs his stuff for the journey)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Two eyes, as often as I can spare them. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>I’m leaving everything to him. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>What about this Ring of yours, is that staying too? </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Yes, yes. It’s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>No, wait, it’s… here in my pocket. Heh, isn’t that, isn’t that odd though? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn’t I keep it? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Well no… And yes! Now it comes to it, I don’t feel like parting with it, its mine, I found it, it came to me! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> There’s no need to get angry. </p>
<p><i>(Bilbo turns towards Gandalf with a furious look on his face)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Well if I’m angry, it’s your fault! It’s mine! My own, my precious. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Precious? Its been called that before, but not by you. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Argh! What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>I think you’ve had that Ring quite long enough. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>You want it for yourself! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf takes a step forward, and talks to Bilbo with a dark, scary voice)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Bilbo Baggins!<i> (Bilbo flings himself towards the wall behind him) </i>Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I’m trying to help you. </p>
<p><i>(Bilbo runs into Gandalf’s arms, weeping)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>All your long years we’ve been friends. Trust me as you once did, hmm? Let it go. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>You’re right Gandalf, the Ring must go to Frodo. It’s late, the road is long. Yes it is time. </p>
<p><i>(He walks towards the door, opens it and starts to walk out)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Bilbo…</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo stops, looking at Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Hmm?</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> …the Ring is still in your pocket. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Oh, yes… </p>
<p><i>(He takes the Ring out of his pocket and looks at it with a stern face. Slowly, he turns his hand, letting the Ring fall to the floor. It hits the floor with a heavy thud. Quickly, Bilbo walks out, stopping a few strides from the door. Gandalf comes out after him)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> I’ve thought of an ending for my book. “And he lived happily ever after…to the end of his days”. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> And I’m sure you will my dear friend. </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Good bye, Gandalf. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Good bye, dear Bilbo. </p>
<p><i>(He walks out of the gate, down the road going east, singing)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began…</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Until our next meeting.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf goes back inside, he stares that the Ring on the floor, bends down and puts his hand over it as if to pick it up. Before he can even touch it, he sees a flash of the Eye of Sauron, surprised he leaves it. Gandalf sits in the study inside Bag End, smoking. He seems to be in deep thought)</i></p>
<p><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(Voice over of Bilbo:) </i></b>It’s mine, my own, my precious!</p>

<p><b>Frodo: </b>Bilbo! Bilbo! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo sees the Ring on the floor and bends down to pick it up. He then notices Gandalf sitting by the fireplace)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> My precious… Precious…</p>
<p><i>(Frodo walks over to Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>He’s gone hasn’t he? He talked for so long about leaving. I didn’t think he’d really do it. </p>
<p><i>(he stops besides Gandalf, the Ring in his hand)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Gandalf? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Hmm. <i>(he sees the Ring in Frodo’s hand) </i>Bilbo’s Ring. He’s gone to stay with the Elves. He’s left you Bag End… <br>
<i>(he gets out an envelope, holding it up to Frodo who puts the Ring in it. He seals it and gives the envelope to Frodo) </i><br>
…along with all his possessions. The Ring is yours now. Put it somewhere out of sight.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf gets his hat and staff and makes for the door)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Where are you going? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> There are some things that I must see to. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>What things? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Questions. Questions that need answering! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> But you’ve only just arrived! I don’t understand. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf turns and looks at Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. </p>
<p><i>(Gollum’s voice is heard from within the dungeouns of Barad Dûr)</i></p>
<p><b>Gollum: </b>Shire!!! Baggins!!! </p>
<p><i>(Gates of Minas Morgul open and the Ringwraiths ride out.</i><br>
<i>Gandalf has ridden through Rohan. He stops his horse, seeing the mountains of Ephel Dûath, the borders of Mordor, looming in the distance, lightning flashes behind and above. He understands that something is happening. He then heads for Minas Tirith. In the library there, he finds what he is seeking)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> <i>(voice over)</i>Year 3434 of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor and the finding of the Ring of Power. It has come to me, the One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All that should follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for I will risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me, though I buy it with a great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell.</p>
<p><i>(Back in the Shire, a farmer is chopping wood outside his hole. His dog begins to bark as something draws near. The dog starts yelping and backs into the hobbit-hole. The farmer looks onto the road in fright, seeing a Ringwraith)</i></p>

<p><b>Frodo:</b> Huh?! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Is it secret?! Is it safe?!</p>

<p><b>Frodo:</b> Ah! </p>

<p><i>(Gandalf get’s out the Ring from the fire with a pair of tongs and hands it to Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Hold out your hand Frodo, it’s quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything? </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Nothing. There’s nothing…<i>(Gandalf takes a sigh of relief.)</i> Wait. There are markings. It’s some form of elvish. I can’t read it.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Mordor..? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> In the common tongue it says, “One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them. One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” </p>
<p><i>(They sit in the kitchen with a cup of tea each. The Ring is placed on the end of the table)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>This is the One Ring. Forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Bilbo found it. In Gollum’s cave. <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf:</b> Yes. For sixty years the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It’s heard its master’s call. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Ring:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> Isildur…</p>
<p><i>(both Gandalf and Frodo stare at the Ring)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo jumps up and grabs the Ring. He enteres the study)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Alright, we put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it’s here, do they? Do they, Gandalf? </p>
<p><i>(he turns to Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first. I don’t know how long they tortured him. Amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: </p>
<p><i>(scene from Barad Dûr and the torturing of Gollum)</i></p>
<p><b>Gollum: </b>Shire!!! Aah!!! Baggins!!! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here!</p>
<p><i>(Scene goes to a road in the Shire, and a Ringwraith rides towards a Hobbit)</i></p>
<p><b>Hobbit: </b>Who goes there?</p>
<p><i>(the Ringwraith chops off the Hobbit’s head. Back in Bag End, Frodo tries to hand the Ring to Gandalf, who refuses)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Take it Gandalf! Take it! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>No Frodo no! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>You must take it! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>You cannot offer me this Ring! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>I’m giving it to you! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Don’t tempt me Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo, I would use this Ring from the desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>But it cannot stay in the Shire! <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf: </b>No! No it can’t. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>What must I do?</p>
<p><i>(Frodo is rushing around, packing for the journey)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> You must leave and leave quickly. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Where? Where do I go? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Bree. What about you? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> I’ll be waiting for you, at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> And the Ring will be safe there? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> I don’t know Frodo. I don’t have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me Frodo, he’ll know what to do. You’ll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you, for that name is not safe outside the Shire. Travel only by day. And stay off the road. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I can cut across country easily enough. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures! You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years, they can still surprise you. <i>(hears a sound from outside)</i> Get down! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo drops down, and Gandalf walks over to the window, then grabs Sam, who has been hiding in the bushes, and throws him onto the table)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Oooff!! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Confound it all Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?!</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>I have been droppin’ no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> A little late for trimming the verge don’t you think? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> I heard raised voices. <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf: </b>What did you hear?! Speak!!!! </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> N-n-n-nothing important. That is I heard a good deal about a Ring and a Dark Lord and something about the end of the world but… Please, Mister Gandalf sir, don’t hurt me. Don’t turn me into anythin’…. unnatural. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> No, perhaps not. I have thought of a better use for you…</p>
<p><i>(next morning, at sunrise)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Come along Samwise, keep up! Be careful both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on, for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf rides off. The Hobbits walk through forests, over hills and in a field far off from Hobbiton, Sam stops.)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Sam:</b> This is it.</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>This is what? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> I take one more step, it’ll be the farthest away from home I’ve ever been. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Come on Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say: “It’s a dangerous business…<i> (voice over of Bilbo)</i>…Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.”</p>
<p><i>(A Black Rider is seen looking down onto Hobbiton. Gandalf rides to Isengard. He gallops past the gates, and towards Orthanc. Saruman walks down the stairs from the door)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom. The hour grows late and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not?..my old friend. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Saruman.</p>
<p><i>(In the gardens outside Orthanc)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> You are sure of this? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Beyond any doubt. </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> The Ring of Power has been found. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose. </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling’s leaf has clearly slowed your mind. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly. </p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>Time?! What time do you think we have?</p>
<p><i>(In Saruman’s chamber inside Orthanc)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf; a great Eye… lidless… wreathed in flame. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> The Eye of Sauron.</p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon he will summon an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle Earth. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>You know this? How? </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> I have seen it.</p>
<p><i>(they enter the chamber of the Palantír)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman. </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Why? Why should we fear to use it? </p>
<p><i>(Saruman uncovers the Palantír)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing Stones. We do not know who else may be watching! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf throws the cloth over the Palantír again. The Eye of Sauron flashes through his mind)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> The hour is later than you think. Sauron’s forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>The Nine!</p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer’s Eve, disguised as riders in black. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>They’ve reached the Shire?! </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> They will find the Ring… and kill the one who carries it. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf heads towards the door, but Saruman closes it with his mind, and then the other doors in turn.)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron. There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Tell me, “friend”, when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?!</p>
<p><i>(Wizard fight begins)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. But you…have elected…the way of pain! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Saruman sends Gandalf flying to the very pinnacle of Orthanc) In the Shire, Sam is in the middle of a field of corn, and seems lost)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Mr. Frodo? Frodo! Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo emerges from around a bend)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> I thought I’d lost you. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> What are you talking about? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> It’s just something Gandalf said. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> What did he say? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> “Don’t you lose him Samwise Gamgee!” And I don’t mean to. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Sam, we’re still in the Shire. What could possibly happen? </p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, Pippin comes out from the cornfield, and knocks over Frodo. Merry comes running too, knocking over Sam. Each carries a heavy load of vegetables)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Frodo? Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins. </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Hello Frodo! </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Get off him! <i>(grabs Pippin and throws him off Frodo) </i>Frodo? Are you all right? </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>What’s the meaning of this? </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Hold this. <i>(hands a bunch of vegetables to Sam) </i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Sam: </b>You’ve been into Farmer Maggot’s crop! </p>
<p><i>(a dog is barking and a yelling voice. Pippin grabs Frodo and runs, followed by Merry. Sam looks after them, before suddenly realizing that he should follow, drops the vegetables, and runs)</i></p>
<p><b>Farmer Maggot:</b> Wait till I get this through you! Stay out of my fields! You ruffians, I’ll catch up with you! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> ‘Dunno why he is so upset. It’s only a couple of carrots!</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> And some cabbages. And those few bags of potatoes that we lifted last week and, and the mushrooms the week before! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Yes Pippin! My point is, he is clearly overreacting. Run! </p>
<p><i>(Pippin, Frodo and Merry stop just before the edge of a hill. Sam, not paying attention, runs into them, sending them all tumbling down the hill.)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Ohh! That was close </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Oww! I think I’ve broken something. <i>(pulls out a broken carrot)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> What? That was just a detour, a shortcut. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>A shortcut to what? </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Mushrooms!</p>
<p><i>(Sam, Merry and Pippin run over to the mushrooms)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>That’s mine!</p>
<p><b>Hobbits:</b> Mmmm..</p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Here is a nice one Sam.</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I think we should get off the road.</p>
<p><i>(The screeching sound of the Nazgûl can be heard from somewhere down the road)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Get off the road! Quick!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(they all hide under a big root beside the road)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Shhh! Stop it! Be quiet!</p>
<p><i>(The Nazgûl appears on a great, black horse, and the hobbits try to hide themselves as well as possible under the tree. The Nazgûl dismounts and bends over to look for the hobbits. It starts to sniff around. Frodo falls into a trance, and slowly grabs the Ring, intending to put it on. Sam hits him, and he wakes up from the trance. Merry throws a bag of vegetables in another direction to distract the Nazgûl, who whirls around. The hobbits take the chance and run off down a hill.)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> What was that?</p>
<p><i>(Frodo stares at the Ring, but says nothing. Later, at nightfall, a Ringwraith is riding trough the forest. The hobbits hide behind a tree)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Anything?</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Nothing. </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>What is going on? </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>That Black Rider was looking for something… or someone. Frodo? </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Get down!</p>
<p><i>(They see a Nazgûl on top of a hill, leaving)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me. </p>
<p><i>(They start to run for the Ferry, when a Nazgûl suddenly appears from behind some bushes. The hobbits are parted, Sam, Merry and Pippin run for the Ferry, with Frodo left behind. He manages to trick the Nazgûl and heads for the Ferry)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Run! This way, follow me! Run!</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Get the rope Sam!</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Hobbits: </b>Run Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Go!</p>
<p><b>Hobbits:</b> Hurry!</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Hobbits:</b> Jump Frodo! Go on faster! Jump!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo jumps onto the ferry, and the Nazgûl’s horse slides just on the edge, nearly falling into the water. The hobbits sit on the ferry, watching the Nazgûl turn around and ride off)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>How far to the nearest crossing?</p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Brandywine Bridge: Twenty miles.</p>
<p><i>(The Nazgûl rides towards Bree, and they see two other Nazgûl joining him)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Come on.</p>
<p><b>Gatekeeper:</b> What do you want?</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> We’re heading for the Prancing Pony. </p>
<p><b>Gatekeeper: </b>Hobbits! Four hobbits! What business brings you to Bree? </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.</p>
<p><b>Gatekeeper: </b>Alright young sir, I meant no offense. It’s my job to ask questions after nightfall. There’s talk of strange folk abroad. Can’t be too careful. </p>
<p><i>(they walk up the road towards the Prancing Pony) </i><br>
<b>Men of Bree:</b> Out of the Way! Watch where you’re going! </p>
<p><i>(They see the sign of the Prancing Pony and enter)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Excuse me?</p>
<p><b>Butterbur:</b> Good evening little masters! If you’re seeking accommodation we’ve got some nice, cozy, hobbit-sized rooms available. Mr. Uh….</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> …Underhill, my name’s Underhill. </p>
<p><b>Butterbur: </b>Underhill. Yes. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>We’re friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we’ve arrived? </p>
<p><b>Butterbur:</b> Gandalf? Gandalf? Ohh yes! I remember, elderly chap, big gray beard, pointy hat. <i>(Frodo nods) </i>Not seen him for 6 months. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>What do we do now?</p>
<p><i>(the hobbits are sitting in the pub, each with his ale.)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Sam. He’ll be here. He’ll come. </p>
<p><b>Man: </b><i>(to Merry coming back from the bar) </i>Get out of my way.</p>
<p><i>(Merry sits down, staring at his pint)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> What’s that? </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>This my friend, is a pint.<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Pippin: </b>It comes in pints? I’m getting one. </p>
<p><i>(Pippin gets up and heads for the bar)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>You had a whole half already! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Sam nudges Frodo in the side and nods towards the corner of the room)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>That fellow’s done nothin’ but stare at you since we arrived.</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> <i>(stops Butterbur as he walks by)</i> Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he? </p>
<p><b>Butterbur:</b> He’s one of them rangers. Dangerous folk they are.. wandering in the wild. What his right name is I’ve never heard but around here, he’s known as Strider.</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Strider…</p>
<p><i>(Frodo starts playing with the Ring, slowly falling into a trance again)</i></p>
<p><b>The Ring:</b> Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins! Baggins!</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Baggins!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo snaps out of his reverie)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Pippin:</b> <i>(sitting by the bar) </i>Sure I know a Baggins. He’s over there, Frodo Baggins. He’s my second cousin once removed on his mother’s side and my third cousin twice removed on his father’s side, if you follow me.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo panics and runs towards Pippin)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Pippin! </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Steady on! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo slips on the wet floor, the Ring flies trough the air, but when he grabs it, it accidentally slips onto his finger, and Frodo disappears. He is in a whirling world of fire and darkness, and suddenly the eye of Sauron appear. The Nazgûl are seen as they suddenly hear the call of the Ring.)</i></p>
<p><b>Voice of Sauron:</b> You cannot hide! I see you! There is no life in the void…only death…</p>
<p><i>(Frodo tries to back away, taking off the Ring at the same time. He appears back in the Prancing Pony)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Ah!</p>
<p><i>(Strider grabs him)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr. “Underhill”! </p>
<p><i>(Strider opens the door to the hobbit’s bedroom and throws Frodo on the floor. Then he walks around the room, putting out the lights)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> What do you want? </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>I carry nothing. </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Indeed. </p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Who are you? </p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>Are you frightened? </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Yes. </p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.</p>
<p><i>(Door opens suddenly, Strider draws his sword, and in come Merry, Pippin and Sam, armed with a candelabra and a three-legged stool)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Let him go! Or I’ll have you, Longshanks! </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> You have a stout heart little hobbit, but that will not save you. You are no longer with the wizard Frodo. They’re coming.</p>
<p><i>(The Nazgûl enter Bree, running down the gate. They walk into the Prancing Pony, and then into the hobbits bedroom. Standing beside each bed, they stab at the same time. When feathers start flying from the beds, they understand that they have been tricked. Their screeches are heard from the streets)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>What are they? </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> They were once men. Great Kings of Men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine Rings of Power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness. <i>(voiceover)</i> Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazgûl, Ringwraiths, neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring. Drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.</p>
<p><i>(Next morning, Strider leads them into the forest. The Nine are seen leaving)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Where are you taking us?</p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>Into the wild. </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>We have no choice but to trust him. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>But where is he leading us? </p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>To Rivendell Master Gamgee, The House of Elrond. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Did you hear that? Rivendell! We’re going to see the elves!</p>
<p><i>(the hobbits pause some place in the wild)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> What about breakfast? </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> We’ve already had it. </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>We’ve had one yes. What about second breakfast?<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Strider walks away)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Don’t think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>What about elevensees? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them, doesn’t he? </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> I wouldn’t count on it. </p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, an apple comes flying trough the air, tossed by Strider. Merry grabs it and hands it to Pippin, before walking off. Another apple hits Pippin in the forehead)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Pippin!</p>
<p><i>(In Isengard, Saruman is in the Chamber of the Palantír, standing over the Palantír. Being in a trance, he is getting contact with Sauron)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> <i>(telepathically)</i> The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth. </p>
<p><b>Voice of Sauron: </b>Build me an army worthy of Mordor! </p>
<p><i>(Saruman sits in another chamber, when two orcs appear)</i></p>
<p><b>Orc:</b> What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? </p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> We have work to do! </p>
<p><i>(The pinnacle of Orthanc. Gandalf wakes up, and realizes where he is. The scene then moves to the gardens of Isengard)</i></p>
<p><b>Orcs:</b> The trees are strong, my Lord. Their roots go deep. </p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>Rip them all down.</p>
<p><i>(The Hobbits and Strider stand below Amon Sûl)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl. We shall rest here tonight. </p>
<p><i>(The hobbits sit down, weary, when Strider gives them each a sword)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider: </b>These are for you. Keep them close. I’m going to have a look around. Stay here.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo is asleep, then he wakes up at the sound of Merry, Pippin and Sam cooking food)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Can I have some meat? </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Ok. Want some tomatoes Sam? </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Great tomatoes</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> What are you doing?! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>We saved some for you Mr. Frodo. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Put it out you fools! Put it out! </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Oh that’s nice! Ash on my tomatoes! </p>
<p><i>(A Nazgûl screech is heard trough the darkness, and the hobbits are alarmed)</i></p>
<p><b>All:</b> Uh?! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo signals to the others to run up the steps to the top of Amon Sûl)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Go! </p>
<p><i>(At the top, they whirl around, waiting, when 5 Nazgûl appear and surround them.) </i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Back you devils!</p>
<p><i>(A Nazgûl hits Sam’s sword, then throws him aside. He hits a stone hard, and lies in a huddle on the ground. Merry and Pippin realize that the Nazgûl are after Frodo and the Ring, and stand in front of him, trying to guard him. Two Nazgûl grab them and throw them in each direction. Frodo backs off, drops his sword, and then falls backwards. He hears the Ring whisper, and takes it out of his pocket. The Witch King “sees” this, draws his dagger and walks towards him. Frodo tries to crawl backwards, but the wall stops him. Trapped in a corner, the Witch King comes closer, and almost stabs him, when Frodo puts on the Ring.</i><br>
<i>His world changes to a whirling mist, and he sees the Nazgûl for what they are. The Witch King reaches for Frodo’s hand, but Frodo draws it back, and so the Witch King stabs him in his left shoulder with his dagger. Frodo screams, then the Witch King draws out the dagger and reaches for the Ring again. Suddenly, a shadow from the left is seen and the Witch King backs off. Frodo manages to take of the Ring and appears back in the “real” world)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Aaaahhhh!</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Frodo! <i>(runs over to Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Oh Sam!</p>
<p><i>(Strider fights the Nazgûl, with sword and fire, and at last, he manages to chase them off)</i></p>
<p><i>Sam: </i>Strider! Help him Strider. </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> He’s been stabbed by a Morgul blade. <i>(the blade vanishes as they look at it)</i> This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine.</p>
<p><i>(Strider carries Frodo, on the way away from Weathertop)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Hurry!</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>We are six days from Rivendell. He’ll never make it!</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Gandalf…</p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Hold on Frodo. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b><i>(Yells)</i>…Gandalf!</p>
<p><i>(The camera flies over Isengard, and up to the Pinnacle of Orthanc, where Gandalf sits. A moth flies into view. Gandalf catches it, and whispers to it) </i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b><i>(whispering)</i> Gwaihir. Go, Gwaihir.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf lifts his hand and the moth flies away. Camera flies down into the Caverns of Isengard as forging of weapons and armor is done. Saruman walks around, observing all the activity with pride and witnesses the birth of Lurtz and the Uruk Hai.</i><br>
<i>Strider and the Hobbits are in the Trollshaws)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Mr. Frodo? <i>(to Strider)</i> He’s going cold!</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Is he going to die? </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> He’s passing into the shadow world. He will soon become a wraith like them.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo gasps and the Nazgûl cry is heard from a distance)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>They’re close.</p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Sam, do you know Athelas plant? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Athelas? </p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Kingsfoil.</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Kingsfoil? Ah, that’s a weed.</p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!</p>
<p><i>(They both search for the plant. Strider finds a small patch and cuts it off with a knife. Suddenly a sword is at his throat)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> What’s this? A ranger caught off his guard? <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo is lying on the ground, when he sees a white light approaching. He turns towards it, and like a vision, and sees Arwen)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> Frodo… Im Arwen. Telin le thaed *I am Arwen. I have come to help you* </p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> Lasto beth nin. Tolo dan na galad *Hear my voice. Come back to the light*</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Who is she?</p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> <i>(kneels) </i>Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>She’s an Elf. </p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>He’s fading! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo gasps as Strider places the Kingsfoil on the wound)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> <i>(to Strider)</i> He’s not going to last. We must get him to my father. I’ve been looking for you for two days. </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Where are you taking him?<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(ignoring Merry)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.</p>
<p><i>(Strider lifts Frodo onto Arwen’s horse, Asfaloth)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Dartho guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon. *Stay with the Hobbits. I will send horses again for you*</p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. *I’m the faster rider. I’ll take him*</p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Andelu i ven. *The road is too dangerous*</p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>What are they saying? </p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>Frodo fir. Ae athradon i hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon. *Frodo dies. If I can get across the river, the power of my people will protect him.*</p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>I do not fear them.</p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Beyest lin. *According to your wish*</p>
<p><i>(Arwen mounts Asfaloth with Frodo seated in front of her)</i></p>
<p><b>Strider:</b> Arwen! Ride hard. Don’t look back! </p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>Noro lim, Asfaloth, noro lim! *Ride fast Asfaloth, ride fast!*</p>
<p><i>(Asfaloth gallops away)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b><i>(angrily to Strider)</i> What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Arwen rides through a forest when the Nazgûl appear, one by one. Amongst the trees and over open spaces they ride. One rides close to Arwen, reaches for Frodo, but is too far away to get him)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>Noro lim Asfaloth! *Ride faster Asfaloth!*</p>
<p><i>(Arwen reaches the Ford, and stops on the other side. The Nazgûl’s steeds stop before touching the water, clearly not wanting to enter the River. Some prance around, and cry out in fear. One of the Nazgûl turns towards Arwen) </i></p>
<p><b>Nazgûl:</b> Give up the halfling, she-elf! </p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> <i>(draws her sword) </i>If you want him, come and claim him! </p>
<p>(The Nazgûl raise their swords and ride into the water. Arwen begins to chant)</p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulair! Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulair! *Waters of the Misty Mountains listen to the great word; flow waters of Loudwater against the Ringwraiths!*</p>
<p><i>(Slowly, the water level rises. A great sound is heard, and everyone turns towards it. A great flood comes around a bend, with peaks like horses galopping. The Nazgûl try to get away, some try to get back to the bank and some flee down the river, but in vain. The flood gets them all and washes them away.</i><br>
<i>Arwen looks after them, when Frodo starts to fall from Asfaloth. Arwen lays him on the ground)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> No! Frodo.. No! Frodo, don’t give in! Not now!</p>
<p><i>(Arwen cries and embraces Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> <i>(voiceover) </i>What grace is given me, let it pass to him… Let him be spared… Save him.</p>
<p><i>(Scene whites out, Elrond appears)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>Lasto beth nin. Tolo dan nan galad. *Hear my voice, come back to the light*</p>
<p><i>(Frodo is lying in a bed at The House of Elrond in Rivendell)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b><i>(half-asleep)</i> Where am I? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>You are in the house of Elrond. And it is 10 o’clock in the morning, on October the 24th if you want to know. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo wakes up</i>)</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Gandalf! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Yes. I’m here. And you’re lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>What happened Gandalf? Why didn’t you meet us? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Oh, I am sorry Frodo…. I was delayed. </p>
<p><i>(Flashback to Isengard. Saruman using his powers, flips Gandalf around, then dangles him dangerously over the edge of Orthanc)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.</p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> One ill turn deserves another. It is over! Embrace the power of the Ring…or embrace your own destruction! </p>
<p><i>(flips Gandalf back towards the platform)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b><i>(slowly raises himself, and it looks like he’s staring at Saruman, but what he realy sees is Gwaihir appearing in the distance) </i>There is only one Lord of the Ring! Only one can bend it to his will. And he does not share power!</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf jumps off the Tower of Orthanc and onto Gwaihir’s back)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> So you have chosen…death.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Gwaihir flies over the mountains, bearing Gandalf to safety)</i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Back to Rivendell)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Gandalf? What is it? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Nothing Frodo. </p>
<p><i>(Sam enters the room)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Frodo! Frodo! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Sam!</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Bless you, you’re awake!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo laughs)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Sam has hardly left your side. </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> We were that worried about you, weren’t we Mr. Gandalf? <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf:</b> By the skills of Lord Elrond, you’re beginning to mend. </p>
<p><i>(Elrond appears behind Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo walks in the gardens with Sam, then he sees Merry and Pippin and runs over to them, hugging them one by one. Then he turns and sees Bilbo sitting on a bench)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Bilbo! <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Bilbo: </b>Hello Frodo my lad! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Bilbo! <i>(hugs)</i></p>
<p><i>(Frodo and Bilbo are in Bilbo’s room and Frodo reads Bilbo’s book)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> “There and Back Again: A Hobbit’s Tale by Bilbo Baggins”.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> (leafs through the book) </i>This is wonderful!<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Bilbo: </b>I meant to go back…wander the powers of Mirkwood… visit Laketown…see the Lonely Mountain again. But age it seems have finally caught up with me. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo stops leafing through the book to look at a map of the Shire)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood, pretending I was off somewhere else.. Off with you on one of your adventures! My own adventure turned out to be quite different. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>I’m not like you, Bilbo.</p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>My dear boy. <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Sam is packing his bag on one of the balconies)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b><i>(to himself) </i>Now what have I forgotten?</p>
<p><i>(Frodo appears behind him)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Packed already? </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> No harm in being prepared. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I thought you wanted to see the Elves Sam. </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> I do! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> More than anything.</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> I did! It’s just…we did what Gandalf wanted didn’t we? We got the Ring this far to Rivendell, and I thought, seeing as how you’re on the mend, we’d be off soon. Off home. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>You’re right Sam. We did what we set out to do. <i>(shows the Ring on his palm) </i>The Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf and Elrond watches Frodo and Sam from the balcony in Elrond’s study)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> His strength returns. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. </p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> And yet to have come so far, still bearing the Ring, the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to it’s evil. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo. </p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Gandalf, the Enemy is moving. Sauron’s forces are massing in the east– his eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman you tell me has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft Saruman has crossed orcs with goblinmen, he’s breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. </p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf walks slowly away, in deep thought. Stopping on another balcony, he gazes out over Rivendell)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf sees Boromir, Legolas and Gimli arrive) </i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> This peril belongs to all Middle Earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the Elves is over- my people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we’ve gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.</p>
<p><i>(turns to Elrond)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>It is in Men that we must place our hope. </p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>Men? Men are weak. <i>(they walk into Elrond’s library as he speaks) </i>The race of men is failing. The blood of Númenor is all but spent. Its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago…<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Flashback to Isildur slicing the Ring off Sauron’s hand)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Elrond:</b> Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed. </p>
<p><i>(Flashback. Isildur lies on the ground after destroying Sauron, and looks at the Ring, when Elrond comes over.)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Isildur hurry. Follow me. </p>
<p><i>(they head for the heart of Mount Doom)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b><i>(voiceover)</i> I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. </p>
<p><i>(At Sammath Naur, Elrond stands near the edge)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Cast it into the fire!</p>
<p><i>(Isildur looks at the Ring in his hand. The Ring whispers to him)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Destroy it!</p>
<p><b>Isildur:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> No…</p>
<p><i>(Isildur turns and walks away)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Isildur!!!</p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> <i>(voiceover)</i> It should’ve ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. </p>
<p><i>(Scene returns to Rivendell) </i><br>
<b>Elrond: </b>Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken. There is no strength left in the world of men. They’re scattered, divided, leaderless. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> There is one who could unite them, one who could reclaim the throne of Gondor. </p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn is reading a book. Boromir enters and pauses to look at the painting of Isildur and Sauron. Then he turns and sees the broken sword. He picks up the hilt and stares at the blade)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut the ring from Sauron’s hand! </p>
<p><i>(Boromir runs his finger up the blade and cuts himself)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b><i>(surprised)</i> It’s still sharp! </p>
<p><i>(He sees Aragorn, who is watching him)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> But no more than a broken heirloom! </p>
<p><i>(He puts back the sword carelessly and it falls to the ground. Boromir stops for a second, but then walks away. Aragorn gets up and picks up the dropped hilt and carefully sets it in place with the other shards. He takes a step back, looking at shards. Arwen walks up behind him)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur’s heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>The same blood flows in my veins. <i>(he turns to Arwen) </i>Same weakness. <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Arwen: </b>Your time will come. You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it. A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor. Ú or le a ú or nin. *The Shadow does not hold sway yet, not over you and not over me.*</p>
<p><i>(Arwen and Aragorn are standing atop of a bridge in the Garden of Twilight)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> Renech i lu i erui govannen? *Do you remember when we first met?*</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen. *I thought I had strayed into a dream.*</p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> <i>(tenderly touches Aragorn’s cheek) </i>Gwenwin in enninath…U-arnech in naeth i si celich. Renech i beth i pennen? *Long years have passed…You did not have the cares you carry now. Do you remember what I told you?*</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> <i>(his fingers run across the Evenstar pendant) </i>You said you’d bind yourself to me. Forsaking the immortal life of your people. </p>
<p><b>Arwen:</b> And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. </p>
<p><i>(she gives him the Evenstar)</i></p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>I choose a mortal life. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> You cannot give me this! </p>
<p><b>Arwen: </b>It is mine to give to whom I will… like my heart. </p>
<p><i>(They kiss)</i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Following morning, the Council of Elrond. Gandalf and Frodo along with a group of Men, Elves and Dwarves sit in a circle around a stone pedestal)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate–this one doom. <i>(gestures to the pedestal) </i>Bring forth the Ring, Frodo. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo rises slowly and places the Ring on the pedestal. He returns to his seat with a sigh. The council members start to whisper among themselves) </i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> So it is true… </p>
<p><b>Someone whispers: </b>The Doom of Man </p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring? <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(paces) </i>Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe! Give Gondor the weapon of the Enemy. Let us use it against him! </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> You cannot wield it! None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.</p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>And what would a ranger know of this matter? </p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, Legolas stands up with an angry look on his face)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Aragorn? <i>(turns towards Aragorn with disbelief in his eyes) </i>This… is Isildur’s heir? </p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>And heir to the throne of Gondor. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo looks wide-eyed at Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Havo dad Legolas *Sit down Legolas*</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. <i>(he returns to his seat with a sigh)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. </p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed. </p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> What are we waiting for?</p>
<p><i>(Gimli grabs his axe and approaches the pedestal)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>ARGH!!</p>
<p><i>(Gimli strikes the Ring as hard as he can, but is thrown back, falling to the ground. Concurrently, Frodo sees the Eye of Sauron in his mind and winces in pain. The Ring remains intact on the pedestal with the shards of the axe around it, whispers in the Black tongue is heard)</i></p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. </p>
<p><b>Ring:</b> <i>(whispers)</i> Ash Nazg<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Elrond:</b> One of you must do this.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Dead silence) </i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. And the great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly! </p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b><i>(stands up)</i> Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed! <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gimli: </b><i>(leaps to his feet)</i> And I suppose you think you’re the one to do it?! </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b><i> (rises) </i>And if we fail, what then?! What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?! </p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! </p>
<p><i>(the other Elves rises and starts shouting at Gimli and the other Dwarves. Legolas holds out his hand to stop them from starting a fight)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Never trust an Elf! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> <i>(rises)</i> Do you not understand that while we bicker among ourselves, Sauron’s power grows?! None can escape it! </p>
<p><b>Man: </b>You’ll all be destroyed!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo watches the Ring, the angry figures of the council reflected on its surface. Suddenly, flames flare up, engulfing the surface of the Ring)</i></p>
<p><b>Ring:</b> Ash Nazg Durbatulûk! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul!</p>
<p><i>(The intensity of the arguments increases. Slowly, Frodo understands what he must do. He rises and takes a step toward the arguing council, trying to make his voice heard above theirs)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I will take it! I will take it!</p>
<p><i>(Everyone stops arguing. Gandalf closes is eyes as he hears Frodo’s statement. Everyone slowly turns toward Frodo, surprised)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though.. I do not know the way. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> <i>(walks towards Frodo) </i>I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, so long as it is yours to bear. <i>(puts his hand on Frodo’s shoulder)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> <i>(rises)</i> If by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. </p>
<p><i>(kneels before Frodo)</i></p>
<p><i>Aragorn:</i> You have my sword. </p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> And you have my bow. <i>(walks over and stands beside Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> And my axe!<i> (he and Legolas exchange dark looks)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b><i>(approaches slowly) </i>You carry the fates of us all little one. If this is indeed the will of the council, then Gondor will see it done. </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Heh! <i>(suddenly emerges from behind some bushes and stands beside Frodo) </i>Mr. Frodo is not goin’ anywhere without me! </p>
<p><b>Elrond:</b> <i>(slightly amused)</i> No indeed, it is hardly possible to separate you even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. </p>
<p><b>Pippin and Merry:<i> </i></b><i>(see Sam in the middle of all the important people. They emerge from behind the pillars and runs down) </i>Wait! We are coming too! </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>You’d have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us! </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission, quest… thing. </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Well that rules you out Pip. </p>
<p><b>Elrond: </b>Nine companions… So be it! You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring! </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Great! Where are we going?</p>
<p><i>(Merry and Frodo look at Pippin)</i></p>
<p><i>(Later that evening, in Bilbo’s Room)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>My old sword, Sting! Here! Take it, take it! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo unsheathes the sword and looks at it)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> It’s so light! </p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Yes…yes.. made by the Elves you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close. And it’s times like that my lad, when you’ll have to be extra careful!</p>
<p><i>(Bilbo holds up a mail shirt)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo:</b> Here’s a pretty thing… Mithril! As light as a feather! And as hard as dragon scales! Let me see you put it on. Go on.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo starts to unbutton his shirt, when Bilbo sees the Ring hanging on a chain around Frodo’s neck)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Oh… M..my old Ring! I sh-sh-should very much like… to hold it again, one last time. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo starts to button up the shirt again to cover the Ring. Bilbo lashes out for it. Frodo startles and backs away. Bilbo turns back to his old self and sits down on the bed, weeping)</i></p>
<p><b>Bilbo: </b>Oh…I’m sorry I brought this upon you my boy…I’m sorry that you must carry this burden. I’m sorry for everything!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(The Fellowship is leaving Rivendell. After traveling over open plains, up and down hillsides, they take a rest on a hill)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for 40 days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there our road turns east to Mordor.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Boromir is training Merry and Pippin how to sword fight, with Aragorn watching)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Two, Three, Four, Five. Good, very good.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Move your feet. </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> That’s good, Pippin. </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Thanks. </p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Faster </p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they’re not, I’d say we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>No Gimli, I would not take the roads through Moria unless I had no other choice.</p>
<p><i>(Legolas jumps from one stone to another, noticing something far away in the South)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Come on. Good. </p>
<p><i>(Boromir accidentally hurts Pippin’s hand)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Aaah! </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Sorry! </p>
<p><i>(Pippin kicks Boromir’s leg) </i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Get him! </p>
<p><i>(Boromir battles with the two hobbits and Boromir and Aragorn laugh)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>For the Shire! </p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Hold him! Hold him Merry!</p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>He got my arm! He got my arm!</p>
<p><i>(Sam notices that Legolas has seen something)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> What is that? </p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> Nothing, it’s just a whisp of cloud. </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> It’s moving fast… Against the wind. </p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> Crebain from Dunland! </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Hide! </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Merry! Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Come on, come on! Take cover!</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship hurries to get their stuff and get into hiding. Sam puts out the fire. They hide behind rocks and in bushes. A huge number of black birds flies over them, cawing loudly. They circle the hill twice, then turn and fly back towards Isengard. The Fellowship comes out from their hidingplaces)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Spies of Saruman! The passage south is being watched. We must take the Pass of Caradhras. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship walks in the deep snow on Caradhras. Frodo stumbles and falls, rolling down the slope towards Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Ahh! </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Aragorn helps him to his feet, and Frodo searches around his neck for the Ring. Finding that it’s gone, he looks back up to where he fell and sees it lying in the snow. Boromir sees it too and picks it up by its chain)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Boromir.</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> It is a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing… Such a little thing.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo. </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> <i>(startles out of his thoughts, but walks down and hands it to Frodo)</i> As you wish. I care not.</p>
<p><i>(Quickly, Frodo grabs the Ring from him. Boromir turns and resumes climbing. Aragorn releases the grip he had on his sword. The Crebain return to the Caverns of Isengard. Saruman gets their message)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go? If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road? </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship (with the exception of Legolas) struggles through the deep snow. The voice of Saruman is heard)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! *Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your horn be bloodstained!*</p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> There is a fell voice on the air. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> It’s Saruman!</p>
<p><i>(The first avalanche falls. The Fellowship barely manages to throw themselves towards the mountainside, avoiding it)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>He’s trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> No! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf takes a step forward, out of the snow, and chants out a spell)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i ‘ruith! *Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!*</p>
<p><i>(Saruman stands on the Pinnacle of Orthanc and continues to cast spells)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar! *Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your bloodstained horn fall upon enemy heads!*</p>
<p><i>(Lightning strikes the top of Caradhras, sending a second avalanche onto the Fellowship. Legolas pulls Gandalf away from the edge, and against the cliff just before the snow buries them completely. After a moment, they emerge from the snow)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!</p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!</p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> If we cannot pass over a mountain, let us go under it. Let us go through the Mines of Moria. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf looks at Gimli with a worried face. Flashback to Saruman in his chamber in Orthanc, reading in the book of lore)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman:</b> Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm… Shadow and Flame! </p>
<p><i>(Flashback ends)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Let the Ring-bearer decide. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Frodo? </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>We will go through the mines. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> So be it. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship arrives at the West Gate of Moria)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> <i>(in awe) </i>The walls of Moria! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(The Fellowship walks by the side of the lake. Frodo’s foot slips into the water) </i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b><i>(gasps)</i></p>
<p><i>(Gandalf stops in front of the doors and makes out an outline of them) </i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Now, let’s see. Ithildin.. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.</p>
<p><i>(The Moon appears from behind the clouds and the doors illuminate)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> It reads “The Doors of Durin – Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.”</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> What do you suppose that means? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Oh it’s quite simple. If you are a friend you speak the password and the doors will open.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Annon edhellen edro hi ammen! *Gate of the Elves open now for me!*</p>
<p><i>(Doors remain closed. Gandalf begins to push it. Time goes. The rest of the Fellowship sits around the doors, waiting for Gandalf to open it)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Ando Eldarinwa a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa! *Gate of Elves listen to my word, Threshold of Dwarves!*</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn takes hold of Bill’s bridle as Sam pets Bill goodbye)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> The mines are no place for a pony, even one so brave as Bill. </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Buh-bye Bill</p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Go on, Bill, go on. Don’t worry Sam, he knows the way home. </p>
<p><i>(Merry throws a stone into the water. Pippin is about to as well, but Aragorn stops him)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Do not disturb the water. </p>
<p><i>(In the meantime, Gandalf gives up and throws his staff on the ground)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Oh, it’s useless! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo looks at the doors, and then as if something popped into his head, he gets up)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>It’s a riddle. Speak “friend” and enter. What’s the Elvish word for friend? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Mellon </p>
<p><i>(The stone doors opens slowly. Everyone turns in surprise and they enter Moria)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Soon Master Elf you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin. And they call it a mine. A mine! </p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>This is no mine, it’s a tomb! </p>
<p><i>(Dead Dwarves lie everywhere on the floor)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Oh! No! Nooo!!! </p>
<p><i>(Legolas picks up an arrow from the body of a fallen dwarf, looks at it carefully and throws it away in disgust)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>Goblins!</p>
<p><i>(Legolas puts an arrow to his bow, Aragorn and Boromir draw out their swords)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here. </p>
<p><i>(The panic starts to grow, the hobbits back towards the door. What they don’t notice is that something is stirring in the water outside)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Now get out, get out! </p>
<p><i>(Everyone heads for the exit. Suddenly Frodo is grabbed from behind and pulled out of the cave by the Watcher in the water)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam, Merry, and Pippin: </b>Frodo! </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Strider! Get off him! </p>
<p><i>(Sam cuts off a tentacle. The Watcher releases Frodo for a second, and moves back under the water. Suddenly many tentacles comes out of the water, it hits the other hobbits aside and grabs Frodo again. He is pulled into the air) </i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Aah! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Aragorn! </p>
<p><i>(Legolas shoots the tentacle holding Frodo. Boromir and Aragorn rush to the water with their swords, and attack the Watcher. It flings Frodo around in the air. Boromir slices the tentacle holding Frodo, who falls, and Boromir catches him. Aragorn and Boromir retreat towards the cave)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Into the Mines! </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Legolas! Aim for his eye! Come on! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Legolas shoots an arrow into the Watcher’s eye. It pulls back and as the Fellowship race into Moria, it reaches out and slams the gates shut. Rocks drop and the roof of the passage collapses. Total darkness falls. Then a faint beam of light emits from Gandalf’s staff, showing the startled faces of the Fellowship)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(The Fellowship carefully makes its way over the floor and up the steps)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Quietly now. It’s a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship enters a great cavern with a walkway down through the middle. They then climb slowly up steep steps on the side of a cavern. For a second, Pippin loses his footing and slips onto Merry)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Pippin! </p>
<p><i>(On the fourth day of their journey, the Fellowship climbs another flight of stairs to a crossroad in the mine: three portals loom before them)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>I have no memory of this place</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship sits around the portals, resting while Gandalf tries to decide which portal to enter)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> Are we lost? </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>No.</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> I think we are. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Shhh! Gandalf’s thinking. <br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Pippin: </b>Merry? </p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>What? </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> I’m hungry. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo looks over his shoulder, back the way they came, and sees a small figure leaping from one stone to another. Scared, he walks over Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>There’s something down there. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>It’s Gollum. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo looks even more scared)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Gollum? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>He’s been following us for three days. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Escaped…Or was set loose?<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(From the distance below, Gollum looks up, his large eyes observe the company)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. He will never be rid of his need for it. <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo looks at Gollum in disgust)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> It’s a pity Bilbo didn’t kill him when he had the chance! </p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?<br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Gandalf:</b> Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise can not see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. </p>
<p><i>(Gollum backs off. Frodo sits down next to Gandalf with a sigh)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf looks towards one of the portals)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Ah! It’s that way.</p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> He’s remembered!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> No, but the air doesn’t smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship heads down the left-hand passage, and soon they come to an open space)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Let me risk a little more light.</p>
<p><i>(His staff illuminates a huge hall of stone lined with tall pillars and arched ceilings as far as the eye can see. All members of the Fellowship, including Gimli, look around in awe)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Now there’s an eye opener, and no mistake. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship walks through the hall. Gimli sees a ray of sunlight shining through the Chamber of Mazarbul.)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Gimli!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Gimli pays no heed to Gandalf, but runs into the chamber. He stops and kneels by a crypt and starts to sob)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> No! No! Noooo! </p>
<p><i>(Boromir moves forward and places his hand on Gimli’s shoulder. Gandalf stops next to Gimli and translates the runes on the tomb)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> “Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.” He is dead then. It’s as I feared. </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf hands his staff and hat to Pippin, bends down, and takes from the grasp of a dead dwarf a large, battered and very old book. He opens it and clears the dirt from its pages. Legolas looks around the chamber and turns to Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>We must move on, we cannot linger!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Gandalf starts to read)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>“They have taken the bridge, and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums, drums in the deep. <i>(turns the page slowly and with caution) </i>We cannot get out. A Shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out…They are coming.”</p>
<p><i>(Pippin sees a corpse sitting by a stone well. Curiously, he reaches out and carefully touches the arrow. The arrowhead breaks off from the rest, causing first the skull to fall. Gandalf turns to see what happens and so do the others. Then the body, the chain and bucket go over the side of the well and fall down into it, causing a loud noise that echoes from hall to hall. Pippin winces at each new wave of noise. Then silence. The Fellowship begins to relax. Gandalf slams the book shut)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity! </p>
<p><i>(He grabs the staff and hat from Pippin, but just then, drums echo up from deep below. Terror creeps into their faces. Sam sees Sting glowing blue)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Foul sounds are heard from the distance outside the chamber)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> Orcs! </p>
<p><i>(Boromir runs to lock the door. Arrows are shot and he is almost hit in the face. Aragorn drops his torch and yells to the Hobbits)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn runs to Boromir and closes the doors. A troll can be heard from outside)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>They have a cave-troll.</p>
<p><i>(Legolas tosses spears and axes to Boromir and Aragorn to help blockade the door. The Fellowship draws out their weapons and Gimli leaps atop Balin’s tomb and brandishes his axe)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Aarghhh!! Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria that still draws breath!</p>
<p><i>(Orcs begin breaking the door down. Legolas and Aragorn shoot at them through the holes in the door. The orcs finally manage through the doors and the battle begins. Suddenly, a cave troll smashes trough the rest of the doors. Legolas shoots an arrow at him, but he just growls. Sam looks up just to see the troll swinging his mace down at him and he throws himself under the troll’s legs just in time. The battle goes on and Sam hits an orc with his frying pan)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>I think I’m getting the hang of this.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo!</p>
<p><i>(Legolas kills orcs on a ledge on one wall. The troll swings his chain at Legolas, who avoids it several times until the troll wraps it around a pillar by accident. Legolas stamps the chain tight and then runs along it onto the troll’s head. He shoots the troll in the back of its head and then jumps off. The troll continues to seek Frodo who tries to hide behind a pillar. After some hide-and-seek, the troll finds him and grabs him. Frodo falls on his back into a corner. The troll lifts him, and he hangs dangling from the troll’s hand.)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Aragorn! Aragorn! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo cuts the troll’s hand with Sting. The troll drops Frodo to the ground and growls)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo!</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn grabs a spear from the floor and stabs the troll in the chest. The troll hits Aragorn and sends him flying across the room. He collapses onto the floor. Frodo crawls after him and tries to rouse him, but Aragorn is too stunned to move. Merry and Pippin throw rocks at the troll to no avail. Frodo begins to run, but the troll blocks his way with a spear, throwing him back into the corner. The troll stabs Frodo in the chest)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Agh!</p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Frodo? Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo falls to the floor)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry and Pippin: </b>Yaahh! </p>
<p><i>(They leap onto the troll’s head and start stabbing him. The troll finally grabs Merry, swinging him around and throws him to the ground. The Fellowship redoubles its efforts against Orcs and troll in furry. Gandalf and Gimli take turns stabbing at the troll and dodging out of range. Legolas takes aim. With Pippin stabbing the troll one more time on the head, the troll opens its mouth. Legolas shoots an arrow into its neck. The troll moans then collapses to the ground. Pippin is thrown against the floor and is knocked out. There is a moment of silence. All Orcs are dead or have fled. Aragorn awakens and crawls over to Frodo.)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Oh no! </p>
<p><i>(He turns Frodo over. Frodo gasps for breath. Sam startles and runs over to them)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>He’s alive! </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I’m all right, I’m not hurt. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> You should be dead! That spear would have skewered a wild boar. </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> I think there’s more to this hobbit than meets the eye.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo reveals his Mithril shirt. Sam touches it in wonder)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> Mithril! You are full of surprises Master Baggins. <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Orcs are once again heard down the hall)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>To the bridge of Khazad-dûm! </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship runs out the back door of the chamber, pursued by a large army of orcs. Other orcs spring out from the floor or crawl down from the ceiling and down the pillars like spiders. They surround the Fellowship, who have drawn their weapons. Just then a fiery light appears at the end of a hall followed by a thunderous growl. The orcs, scared, flee panicking in all directions. The Fellowship stares towards the light.)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>What is this new devilry? </p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! Quickly!</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship runs trough the Hall, and enters a passageway, then down a flight of steps. Parts of the steps end into a chasm and Boromir nearly falls into it. Legolas pulls him back just before he is about to fall in. The hobbits too stop short of falling in. They take another flight of stairs down. Aragorn and Gandalf bring up the rear)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Gandalf.</p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Lead them on Aragorn. The bridge is near.<i> (Aragorn resists, but Gandalf pushes him away) </i>Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship runs down the steep staircase. Halfway down, they encounter a gap on the stairs. Legolas leaps forward and lands on the other side. He waves to Gandalf)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>Gandalf.</p>
<p><i>(Gandalf looks back up towards the Hall as they hear a loud growl and stones fall around them. Then he leaps after Legolas. Suddenly, arrows whistle in the air, striking the steps they stand on. Legolas and Aragorn shoot back, killing many orcs)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Merry! Pippin! Hoo-aah!</p>
<p><i>(He takes Merry and Pippin, one on each side, and leaps forward, landing on the other side)</i><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Aragorn:</b> Sam. </p>
<p><i>(He throws Sam to the other side and is caught by Boromir. Aragorn reaches to pick up Gimli, but he holds up his hand)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Nobody tosses a Dwarf. </p>
<p><i>(Before Aragorn manages to do anything, Gimli leaps forward but nearly falls back into the chasm. Legolas grabs his beard)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Not the beard!</p>
<p><i>(Some of the stone steps crumble and fall into the fires below. Aragorn pushes Frodo back up the steps and climbs after him. They struggle to their feet and look at the widened gap that separates them from the rest of the Fellowship. The Balrog is heard from the other hall, its fiery light is seen. Stone structures around the mine collapse as it draws near. A huge rock falls from the ceiling and smashes down the steps behind Aragorn and Frodo, creating another gap behind them and weakening the stairs’ foundation. The stairs begin to wobble)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Stay there. Hold on. Hang on! Lean forward!</p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>Come on!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo and Aragorn shift their weight forward, tipping the stairs across the divide and slamming onto the steps where their companions are. They leap across to safety, caught by Legolas and Boromir. They continue to run down the stairs as the stone structures collapse behind them)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Over the bridge! Fly!</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship crosses the bridge. Gandalf stops halfway over and turns to face the Balrog, who appears out of the fires, growling)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>You cannot pass! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Gandalf! </p>
<p><i>(A blazing light radiates from Gandalf’s staff, illuminating the entire bridge and its surroundings)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> I am the servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you! flame of Udûn!</p>
<p><i>(The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with a flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrog’s sword)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>Go back to the Shadow!</p>
<p><i>(The Balrog brandishes a flaming whip, lashing it about menacingly)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf: </b>YOU…SHALL NOT…PASS!! </p>
<p><i>(Gandalf strikes his staff and sword onto the bridge. The Balrog stops, not knowing what to do. As it steps forward, the bridge collapses under it and the demon falls backward into the chasm, growling. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths and winds about Gandalf’s ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip. Frodo rushes forward, but Boromir restrains him)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>No, Frodo! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Gandaaalf!!</p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> Fly you fools! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the abyss) </i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Nooooooo!!!</p>
<p><i>(Boromir grabs Frodo and runs, heading for the stairs leading to the East Gate)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Aragorn! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Nooooooo!!!</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn is shocked. He stares at the bridge in disbelief, unable to move for a few moments. But then orc arrows start whistling by once again. Dodging, he turns and follows the others up the stairs and out in the light.</i><br>
<i>The Fellowship comes running out of the East Gate of Moria. Everyone is distraught. Sam sits on the ground, bows his head onto his hands and begins to weep. Merry consoles Pippin, who lies on the ground crying. Boromir tries to restrain Gimli as the dwarf vents out his rage and sorrow. Legolas wears a look of shock and disbelief.</i><br>
<i>Aragorn stands on a distance from the others, cleaning his sword and re-sheathing it. Then he turns to the others)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Legolas, get them up.</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Give them a moment for pity’s sake. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> By nightfall these hills will be swarming with orcs! We must reach the Woods of Lothlórien. Come Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up. </p>
<p><i>(Aragorn reaches down to pick up Sam.)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> On your feet, Sam. <i>(Aragorn looks around for Frodo) </i>Frodo? Frodo!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo, several paces away, grieves alone. Weeping silently, he turns towards Aragorn. They continue the journey, Aragorn running in front of them. They cross Dimrill Dale and enter the Woods of Lothlórien. Slowly, they walk under the huge trees)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Stay close young hobbits! They say there’s a great sorceress lives in these woods, an Elf-witch of terrible power. All who look upon her, fall under her spell… </p>
<p><b>Galadriel’s Voice: </b><i>(whisper) </i>Frodo… <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo, startled, looks around) </i></p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> …and are never seen again. </p>
<p><b>Galadriel’s Voice: </b>Your coming to us… <i>(Frodo stops)</i>..is as the footsteps of Doom. You bring great evil here Ring-bearer!</p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Mr. Frodo?<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo starts walking again)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Well, here’s one Dwarf she won’t ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!</p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, Gimli has an arrow pointed towards him. Lórien Elves appear from behind the trees, aiming at the others as well. The Fellowship stops and looks around, alarmed)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Oh.. </p>
<p><b>Haldir:</b> The Dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark. </p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b><i>(mumbles) </i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Haldir o Lórien. Henion aníron, boe ammen i dulu lîn. Boe ammen veriad lîn. *Haldir of Lorien, we come here for help. We need your protection.*</p>
<p><i>(Gimli looks at the arrows pointing at him without moving)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Aragorn, these woods are perilous! We should go back.</p>
<p><b>Haldir: </b>You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back. <i>(he looks at Frodo) </i>Come, she is waiting. </p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship arrives at Caras Galadhon. They walk up a winding stairway amongst the trees, towards the grand court of Galadriel and Celeborn. With a glow issuing forth from them, the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien descend to meet the Fellowship, hand in hand. Aragorn touches his head reverently in greeting. The rest of the Fellowship stares in awe)</i></p>
<p><b>Celeborn:</b> Eight there are here yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. </p>
<p><i>(Galadriel looks at Aragorn, reading the answer in his eyes)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>He has fallen into shadow. <i>(she looks around at the Fellowship) </i>The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all. </p>
<p><i>(Galadriel looks at Boromir with a piercing gaze which he can’t stand. He starts shaking and casts his eyes downwards)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>Yet hope remains while the Company is true. </p>
<p><i>(She looks at Sam and smiles. Sam continues to gaze at her)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight you will sleep in peace… <i>(whispers to Frodo in his mind) </i>Welcome Frodo of the Shire. One who has seen the Eye!</p>
<p><i>(Later, back on the ground, an area has been provided for them to rest in. The hobbits are settling down. In the trees, the Elves’ singing can be heard)</i></p>
<p>A Olorin i yaresse *Olorin, who once was…* Mentaner i Numeherui…*sent by the Lords of the West…*</p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>A lament for Gandalf. </p>
<p><i>(Merry looks up towards the trees)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>What do they say about him?</p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>I have not the heart to tell you. For me the grief is still too near. </p>
<p>Tirien i Romenori *to guard the lands of the East…*<br>
Maiarion i Oiosaila… *wisest of all Maiar…*<br>
Mana elye etevanne… *what drove you to leave…*<br>
Norie i melanelye? *that which you loved?*</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn walks over to Boromir, who is seated alone on a great tree root)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Take some rest. These borders are well protected. </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me even now there is hope left. But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope.</p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing. And now our…our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. <br>
Have you ever seen it Aragorn? White tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? <i>(he turns towards Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>I have seen the White City, long ago. </p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guards shall take up the call: The Lords of Gondor have returned!</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship is asleep. Galadriel walks by in silence. Frodo wakes up with a start and proceeds to follow her. Galadriel walks down to her garden and fills the ewer with water. She turns towards Frodo, not surprised to see him there)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>Will you look into the mirror? </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> What will I see? </p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things. </p>
<p><i>(She begins to pour the water into the silver basin) </i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> Things that were, things that are and some things…<i> (empties the ewer)</i> that have not yet come to pass.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo steps up to the mirror to take a look. He peers down and sees nothing but his reflection. Then suddenly the mirror clears and shows a vision of Legolas, Merry and Pippin, then Sam. He sees Bag End, then the burning of Hobbiton, the enslavement of the Hobbits and the destruction of the Shire. Then suddenly the Eye of Sauron fills the entire mirror. The Ring hanging from Frodo’s neck pulls him closer to the water. Steam begins to curl up from the basin as Sauron speaks to Frodo in Black Speech. Terrified, he grabs the Ring and jerks back, throwing himself off the step and landing on his back on the grass)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>I know what it is you saw, for it is also in my mind. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(speaks to Frodo telepathically) </i>It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. It has already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one it will destroy them all. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b><i>(telepathically)</i> If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.</p>
<p><i>(Opening his palm, he offers the Ring to her)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. </p>
<p><i>(She approaches Frodo, her hand open. Her image begins to change)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> In place of a DARK LORD, YOU WILL HAVE A QUEEN! NOT DARK BUT BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE AS THE DAWN! TREACHEROUS AS THE SEA! STRONGER THAN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH! ALL SHALL LOVE ME AND DESPAIR!</p>
<p><i>(She returns to normal with a scared look on her face)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> I pass the test! I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I cannot do this alone. </p>
<p><i>(she turns to him)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b>You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of power is to be alone. This task was appointed to you and if you do not find a way, no one will. </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Then I know what I must do. It’s just… I’m afraid to do it. </p>
<p><i>(Galadriel bends down to meet him at eye level)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.</p>
<p><i>(In Orthanc in Isengard, Saruman and Lurtz are standing in the central chamber)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>Do you know how the Orcs first came into being? (he begins to walk in circle around Lurtz) They were Elves once, taken by the Dark Powers. Tortured and mutilated.. A ruined and terrible form of life. Now…perfected.. my fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?</p>
<p><b>Lurtz:</b> Saruman!</p>
<p><i>(The Uruk-Hai wear their armor and are given their weapons. They receive a white handprint on their heads and faces, signifying Saruman’s army. They then assemble before him)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b><i>(to the troops) </i>Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man flesh!</p>
<p><i>(The troops growl. Saruman turns to Lurtz)</i></p>
<p><b>Saruman: </b>One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(The Uruk-Hai leave Isengard and the scene returns to Lothlórien. Frodo sits in one of the boats they have been given, together with Sam and Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel: </b><i>(voiceover)</i> Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.</p>
<p><i>(Galadriel hands Frodo a crystal phial)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> Namárië.</p>
<p><i>(she kisses his hair)</i></p>
<p><b>Galadriel:</b> <i>(voiceover)</i> May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.</p>
<p><i>(Galadriel raises her hand in farewell as the Fellowship canoes down the river. They reach the great river. The Uruk-Hai are seen marching along through the forest as the three boats carrying the Fellowship float along the Anduin. The boats pass through a canyon. Aragorn lifts his head, half-smiles and taps Frodo on the shoulder)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo, the Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin.</p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship looks up in awe at the towering splendor of the Argonath. Two majestic statues, carved out of the mountain, proudly stand on each side of the Anduin. Their left arms are held aloft, their palms facing outwards in gesture of warning. Stern are their faces.)</i></p>
<p><i>(The Fellowship reaches the foot of Amon Hen, the Hill of Sight. As they reach the beach of Parth Galen, Boromir looks troubled and appears to be fighting a conflict within him. The Fellowship starts to make camp)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. We approach Mordor from the north.</p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Oh, yes?! It’s just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil? An impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks! And after that, it gets even better! <i>(Pippin looks up, alarmed) </i>Festering, stinking marshlands far as the eye can see!</p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength Master Dwarf.</p>
<p><b>Gimli:</b> Recover my…?! Grrrrrr.</p>
<p><i>(Legolas looks into the forest around them, then turns to Aragorn)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas: </b>We should leave now.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.</p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near… I can feel it!</p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>No dwarf need recover strength! <i>(turns to Pippin)</i> Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Merry, returning with some wood for the campfire, looks around, alarmed)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Where’s Frodo?</p>
<p><i>(Sam, who was half-dozing, rouses with a start. Aragorn looks over the camp. His gaze stops on Boromir’s shield, lying with the baggage and he understands that Boromir is also gone.</i><br>
<i>In the forest, Frodo wanders around. He stands by an immense stone head, lying with its side on the ground. Boromir, gathering wood, sees Frodo and approaches him)</i></p>
<p><i>(Frodo starts backing away, Boromir continutes to follow him)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo, other paths that we might take.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo starts backing away from Boromir, who continues to walk towards him)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>I know what you would say. And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.</p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Warning? Against what? We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have. Don’t you see that is madness?</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>There is no other way!</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> I ask only for the strength to defend my people!<i> (in anger, he throws the gathered wood to the ground) </i>If you would but lend me the Ring…</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> No! <i>(steps back)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Why do you recoil? I am no thief.</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>You are not yourself.</p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>What chance do you think you have? They will find you! They will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo turns and begins to run from Boromir)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> You fool!</p>
<p><i>(Boromir gives chase)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It could’ve been mine! <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(he catches Frodo and tackles him) </i>It should be mine! Give it to me!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo struggles to keep him away from the Ring)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Give it to me!</p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>No!</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Give me… Give me the Ring!</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Noo…ugh!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo slips the Ring on and disappears. He kicks Boromir and runs away. Boromir looks around desperately)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you! And all the halflings!</p>
<p><i>(Boromir slips and falls to the ground. The madness of the Ring leaves him and he comes to his senses)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Frodo? Frodo?…what have I done?…please…Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b><i>(from far away)</i> Frodo, I’m sorry! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo is in the “shadow world,” climbing up onto the Seat of Seeing atop Amon Hen. He looks over the stone seat and sees the Dark Tower from afar. The image rushes towards him and his vision rise to its pinnacle where the burning Eye of Sauron stares back menacingly, the Dark Lord speaking to him in black speech. Frodo, rushing to remove the Ring, falls off the Seat of Seeing and lands on his back beneath it. He sits up, trying to catch his breath. Aragorn approaches)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Frodo?<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Frodo starts and turns around)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> It has taken Boromir.</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn takes a step towards Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Where is the Ring?</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Stay away! </p>
<p><i>(he scrambles up and retreats from Aragorn, and in under the Seat of Seeing. Aragorn comes after him)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo stops)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>I swore to protect you!</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Can you protect me from yourself?!</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn suddenly understands why Frodo reacted like he did. Frodo shows the Ring on his palm)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Would you destroy it?</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn, looking at the Ring, slowly approaches Frodo. The Ring begins to whisper)</i></p>
<p><b>The Ring: </b>Aragorn…Aragorn…Elessar…</p>
<p><i>(He reaches out, with both hands, Aragorn closes Frodo’s hand over the Ring and pushes it to the hobbit’s chest)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor.</p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I know. Look after the others, especially Sam. He will not understand.</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn nods with tears in his eyes, but then sees Sting glowing blue. He stands suddenly)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Go Frodo. <i>(he draws out his sword)</i> Run. <i>(Frodo hesitates) </i>Run!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo turns around and leaves. Aragorn walks out from beneath the Seat of Seeing and finds a troop of Uruk-Hai advancing towards him. He gives a half-smile, holding his sword up to his face as an acceptance to the challenge. They attack. He cuts several down, but they force him up the stairs of the Seat. Further down in the forest, everyone is around looking for Frodo. Sam searches frantically)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Mr.Frodo!!</p>
<p><i>(Suddenly, he hears the clash of sword on sword. His eyes widen) </i></p>
<p><b>Lurtz: </b><i>(to his troops)</i> Find the Halfling! Find the Halfling! </p>
<p><i>(Aragorn jumps from the top of the Seat of Seeing and onto the Uruk-Hai)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Elendil!!!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Legolas and Gimli run forward from behind the Seat. Legolas shoots three Uruk-Hai; Gimli lands blow after blow with his axe)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> Aragorn! Go! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo runs and hides behind a tree. Some of the Uruk-Hai run past, not seeing him. Across the way, Merry and Pippin hide in a space under some fallen tree trunks and bushes)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Frodo!</p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Hide here quick! Come on!</p>
<p><i>(Frodo looks at them, anguished, then shakes his head.)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> <i>(to Merry)</i> What’s he doin’? <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Merry suddenly understands what’s going on)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>He’s leavin’. </p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> No! </p>
<p><i>(Pippin runs out from the hiding place, towards Frodo)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>Pippin! </p>
<p><i>(Merry comes after him, and they are out in the open. Several Uruk-Hai are coming down the hill, towards where they stand. They stare at them, then Merry turns to Frodo.)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry: </b>(<i>in a low voice)</i> Run Frodo! Go!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Merry cups his hands and calls out to the Uruk-Hai)</i></p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Hey! Hey you! Over here! </p>
<p><i>(Pippin and Frodo look at him in surprise, then Pippin understands the deal)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin: </b>Hey! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> Over here!</p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> <i>(waving his arms hysterically)</i> This way!</p>
<p><i>(Both hobbits run away from Frodo. The Uruk-Hai troop follows them. Frodo stares after them, unsure of what to do, then he makes a decision and runs in the opposite direction)</i></p>
<p><b>Pippin:</b> It’s working! </p>
<p><b>Merry:</b> I know it’s working! Run!</p>
<p><i>(Merry and Pippin run across an old stone bridge. At its far end, they stop and see Uruk-hai running towards them from another direction. The Uruks are closing in, both in front and behind. An Uruk runs up to them, raising his axe. But Boromir comes charging in, knocks the Uruk back, and kills him with his sword. He throws a knife at another.</i><br>
<i>Back at the Seat of Seeing, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli continue to fight the Uruk-Hai. In one smooth move, Legolas stabs one Uruk with an arrow then shoots it out at another. Aragorn stabs one behind his back. </i><br>
<i>Legolas shoots first 3 Uruks in a row, then one who has closed in on Aragorn. Three loud ox-horn blasts are heard)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> The Horn of Gondor! <br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Aragorn runs forward)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Boromir!</p>
<p><i>(They run down the hills of Amon Hen towards the sound, but Uruks are between them and Boromir. A visual sweep shows some running towards Boromir, down the stone steps; the others attack Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they struggle to follow.</i><br>
<i>Boromir sounds the horn of Gondor again)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> <i>(to the hobbits)</i> Run! Run! </p>
<p><i>(The Uruks attack Boromir. He kills two more. Lurtz walks slowly into view, lifts his bow, aims a big black arrow, and shoots it into Boromir’s left shoulder. He gasps for breath and the hobbits look at him in shock. Boromir drops to his knees, begins to breathe hard, and looks at the hobbits. Uruks come closer, but he gives a battle cry, rises, and swings his sword at one, who falls. Lurtz growls, lifts his bow, and shoots again. A black arrow flies into Boromir’s stomach. He drops to his knees again, gasping. But he swings his sword at another Uruk and gets back up. Lurtz shoots him one more time, in the chest. Boromir falls on his knees and stays there, swaying a little and blinking.</i><br>
<i>Merry and Pippin look at him in shock. With all the courage they can find, they take up their swords and attack the Uruk-Hai with a cry) </i></p>
<p><b>Merry and Pippin: </b>Shire!!!!</p>
<p><i>(They never have the chance to strike. The Uruk-Hai lift them up and carry them off. Merry and Pippin wave their arms frantically. The Uruk-Hai troop walks past Boromir. Boromir stares after the hobbits, helpless.</i><br>
<i>Lurtz, now left alone, stops ten feet from Boromir and takes aim with his bow again. Boromir swallows and stares back at him. Just as Lurtz is about to let go of the arrow, Aragorn crashes into him, and the arrow flies off harmlessly.</i><br>
<i>They start a fight. Aragorn loses his sword and is thrown to the ground. When he gets up, Lurtz throws his shield at Aragorn and pins him by the neck against a tree. Lurtz raises his sword and strikes, but Aragorn slips beneath the shield and dodges. Aragorn pulls out a knife and stabs Lurtz in the leg. Lurtz roars and knocks Aragorn to the ground, making him roll a few feet away. Lurtz then pulls the knife out of his leg and throws it at Aragorn, who has found his sword and uses it to bat the knife away. Aragorn closes in on Lurtz and in a flurry of swordplay, slices his arm off and then stabs him in the chest. Lurtz grabs Aragorns sword and pulls himself up onto it, closer to Aragorn, snarling. Aragorn grimaces, pulls his sword out of Lurtz, swings it wide, and hacks off the Uruk’s head. The rest of Lurtz’s body falls to the ground.</i><br>
<i>Aragorn pauses a moment, panting. He then notices Boromir. Boromir, pale and bloodied, is now lying on his back, his head close to a tree) </i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> No! </p>
<p><i>(he runs up and kneels near Boromir)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> They took the little ones.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Be still.</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Frodo, where is Frodo? </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> I let Frodo go. </p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>The Ring is beyond our reach now. </p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Forgive me, I did not see it. I have failed you all.</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> No, Boromir, you fought bravely! You have kept your honor. </p>
<p><i>(he reaches out to pull the arrows from Boromir, but Boromir grabs his arm to stop him)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Leave it! It is over. The world of Men will fall, and all will come to darkness… And my city to ruin. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall, nor our people fail!</p>
<p><b>Boromir:</b> Our people? Our people. </p>
<p><i>(He reaches for his sword, but can’t get it. Aragorn places the hilt in his hand, and Boromir clasps it to his chest)</i></p>
<p><b>Boromir: </b>I would have followed you my brother, my captain, my king!</p>
<p><i>(Boromir passes away. Aragorn touches his hand to his forehead, then to his lips in respect)</i></p>
<p><b>Aragorn: </b>Be at peace, son of Gondor. </p>
<p><i>(He bends and kisses Boromir on the brow. Legolas and Gimli arrive at the scene. Legolas looks sadly at Aragorn and Boromir, seeing what is going on. Gimli bows his head and turns away. </i><br>
<i>Aragorn stands up, looking into the forest with a tear running down his face.)</i><br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Sam is running through the woods, towards the beach where they left the boats)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Frodo stands upon Parth Galen, staring towards the opposite shore, with the Ring on his palm. Weeping silently, he recalls his conversation with Gandalf.)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b><i>(voiceover) </i>I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. </p>
<p><i>(as he hears Gandalf’s voice, Frodo’s expression changes)</i></p>
<p><b>Gandalf:</b> <i>(voiceover)</i> So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.</p>
<p><i>(Frodo decides to leave. Determined to proceed with the quest alone, he closes his hand over the Ring, and puts it into his vest pocket. He pushes the boat into the river and jumps in. Just then, Sam emerges from the woods. He sees Frodo paddling away and runs after him)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Frodo, no! Frodo! Mr. Frodo! </p>
<p><i>(Sam stops on the edge of the shore, the water reaching his ankles)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> <i>(in a low voice to himself)</i> No Sam. </p>
<p><i>(Frodo continues to paddle away. Sam runs into the river after Frodo. Frodo, hearing the splashes, looks back)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Go back Sam! I’m going to Mordor alone. </p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>Of course you are, and I’m coming with you! </p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>You can’t swim! Sam!<br>
<i></i><br>
<i>(Sam struggles to swim then sinks into the water.)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Sam!!!</p>
<p><i>(Sam sinks deeper and deeper. He sees the sun shimmering up on the surface. His arm floats lifelessly in the water. Suddenly Frodo’s hand reaches down and grabs Sam’s wrist. Sam tightens his hand around Frodo’s and is pulled out of the water and up into the boat. Sam tumbles in. Frodo looks at him with tears in his eyes. Sam, dripping wet, looks back)</i></p>
<p><b>Sam: </b>I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise! “Don’t you leave him Samwise Gamgee.” And I don’t mean to! I don’t mean to.</p>
<p><i>(Sam begins to weep)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Oh Sam! </p>
<p><i>(He embraces Sam and they give each other a great hug)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo: </b>Come on. </p>
<p><i>(Sam grabs an oar and they paddle towards the eastern shore.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Boromir is laid to rest in one of the other boats. His sword rests with him, his shield is above his head and his cloven horn at his side. The boat slips over the falls of Rauros and then drops into the mists below. Gimli watches the boat disappear. Aragorn wears Boromir’s vambraces in his honor. Legolas shoves the third boat into the water)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.</p>
<p><i>(Aragorn stands still, looking towards the shore on the other side, seeing the two Hobbits running into the forest. He says nothing but sighs. Legolas stares at him, suddenly understanding)</i></p>
<p><b>Legolas:</b> You mean not to follow them. </p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Frodo’s fate is no longer in our hands. </p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Then it has all been in vain! The Fellowship has failed. </p>
<p><i>(Legolas and Gimli walks up to Aragorn, who puts his hands on their shoulders</i>)</p>
<p><b>Aragorn:</b> Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let’s hunt some orc! </p>
<p><i>(Aragorn turns and picks up a dagger from the ground. Then he runs of into the forest. Legolas and Gimli look at each other, grinning)</i></p>
<p><b>Gimli: </b>Yes!! Haha!</p>
<p><i>(They run after Aragorn.)</i></p>
<p><i>(Frodo and Sam stand upon Emyn Muil, seeing the Dead Marshes and Mordor in the distance)</i></p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> Mordor. I hope the others find a safer route. </p>
<p><b>Sam:</b> Strider will look after them. </p>
<p><b>Frodo:</b> I don’t suppose we’ll ever see them again. </p>

				<p>I’m kind of disappointed that this wasnt the xtended version..(and that some of the script was a little mixed up)<br>
if anyone wants the xtended version badly someone who helps out here could pm me and i could maybe help…i think it’s much better. (i wouldnt mind) I didn’t actually read the whole review, but ill rate this on what I did read.</p>
<p>(the prologue was perfect…btw, ive actually done that myself)</p>

				<p>Thanks for your immense work! I have only been able to see the film in the German translation (which is not very good sometimes). It is really interesting to read the original scripts and to compare them to the translated version.   </p>

				<p>Thanks so much for doing that!!  I’ve been writing some fan fic and the script has helped a lot…The extended version would be cool, mainly I would like to see the part when Aragorn and Halider are talking in Elvish.  I want to know what they are saying!<br>

				<p>thanks for having done this! i am glad i checked this out. the elvish parts of the script were the ones that i really liked…i’ve been looking for the written versions of the elvish dialogues coz its hard to just listen to them with some character saying the english parts louder…;-)</p>

				<p> hey i thought it was a great script but my friend and i printed the sript to check for errors n there are alot of errors like when they say in the Prologue by Galadriel:It betrayed Isildur to his death…<br>
before that they say that isildur has this one chance to destroy evil forever</p>

				<p>i must say it’s truly a privelige to get to read the whole script!! i’ve been searching for it..and boom! there i found it…<br>
very nissssssssssssssee! ( nice!) </p>
<p>just one thing :</p>
<p>Frodo: Its wonderful to see you Gandalf!</p>
<p>isn’t there suppose to be an apostrophe infront of the `s`?<br>
there are perhaps more..didnt look through it properly, as it is for that! but it was EXPLENDID</p>

				<p>I am very disappointed that you did not do the extended version, and that this script was very mixed up. Definitely the worst among the three. But, really, I shouldn’t say anything because you put much effort for these. Good job on TTT and ROTK, but your FOTR script is a little off.</p>
