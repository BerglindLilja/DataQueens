== Biography ==

Elanor was born [[March 25]], [[TA 3021|3021]], or [[SR 1421|1421]] [[Shire Reckoning]]. In [[SR 1436]], she was made a maid to [[Queen]] [[Arwen]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Six years later, she visited [[Gondor]] with her parents for a year. Elanor married [[Fastred of Greenholm]] in SR 1451. Her first son, [[Elfstan Fairbairn]] was born three years later. She also had a daughter, [[Fíriel Fairbairn]].<ref name=":0">[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[Appendix B]], The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), The Third Age, Later Events Concerning the Members of the Fellowship of the Ring</ref>

In SR 1455, [[Thain]] [[Peregrin Took]], at the request of Sam, made Elanor's husband the [[Warden of Westmarch]]. Elanor and Fastred moved to [[Undertowers]] on the [[Tower Hills]] in the [[Westmarch]]. In SR 1482, Elanor's mother, Rosie, died and her father Sam left [[Bag End]]. He gave Elanor, the last person to see him, the [[Red Book of Westmarch|Red Book]] before going to the [[Grey Havens]] and departing.<ref name=":0" />

Elanor was known as "the Fair" for her beauty; many people thought she looked more like an Elf-maid than a hobbit girl. She had golden hair, which until the year SR 1420 was extremely rare for hobbits.
