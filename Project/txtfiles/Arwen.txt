{{Quote|For I am the daughter of Elrond. I shall not go with him when he departs to the Havens: for mine is the choice of Lúthien, and as she so have I chosen, both the sweet and the bitter.|''The Return of the King'', "[[Many Partings]]"}}

'''Arwen''' was the [[Half-elven]] daughter of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]]. She was often called '''Arwen Undómiel''' or "'''Evenstar'''".

In marrying [[Aragorn II Elessar]] after the [[War of the Ring]], she became Queen of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and like [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] before her, she united Elf and Man in peace, while becoming mortal.

==Biography==
===Early life ===
Arwen was born in [[TA 241]], to Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrían of [[Rivendell]].<ref name="appendixb" /> Like her father and brothers, she had the right to choose between [[Immortality|immortality]] or mortal life. She lived most of her life in Rivendell and [[Lothlórien]] interchangeably.

===Third Age===
====Aragorn and Arwen====
[[File:Aragorn and Arwen - The Fellowship Of The Ring.jpg|alt=|thumb|260x260px|Aragorn and Arwen "plight their troth"]]
During Aragorn's twentieth year, he met Arwen for the first time in [[Rivendell]], where he lived under Elrond's protection. Arwen, then over 2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living for a while with her grandmother [[Galadriel]] in [[Lórien]]. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for Lúthien, thinking he had fallen into a dream.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix A: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenórean Kings, (v): "The tale of Aragorn and Arwen"</ref>

About thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lórien, where Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love and they "plighted their troth" (promised themselves to each other) on the mound of [[Cerin Amroth]], Arwen choosing to become mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up the chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm. Arwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war. While the War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which would become his standard after he became king.
[[File:Aragorn and Arwen - The Two Towers.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|240x240px|Arwen and Aragorn in the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|films]]]]
Before taking the [[Paths of the Dead]], Aragorn was met by a group consisting of [[Dúnedain]], and Arwen's brothers, [[Elladan and Elrohir]]. They brought to him a [[Aragorn's standard|banner of black cloth]]: a gift made by Arwen, and a sign that encouraged him to take the difficult path.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings, [[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter II: "[[The Passing of the Gray Company]]"</ref> When the banner was unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to reveal the emblem of [[Elendil]] in [[Mithril]], [[gems]], and [[gold]], it was the first triumphant announcement of the King's return.

====After the War====
[[File:Aragorn and Arwen - The Return Of The King.jpg|alt=|thumb|Queen Arwen and King Aragorn Elessar are wed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'']]
Arwen arrived at [[Minas Tirith]] after Aragorn had become King of [[King of Gondor|Gondor]] and [[Kings of Arnor|Arnor]], and they married on [[Midsummer's Day]] in the year [[TA 3019]], after the end of the [[War of the Ring]]. She became [[Queen]] of the [[Reunited Kingdoms]] of Arnor and Gondor. After marrying [[Aragorn]], she bestowed upon [[Frodo Baggins]] a gift; her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore Aragorn's son, [[Eldarion]], and several unnamed daughters, some time in the [[Fourth Age]].

===Fourth Age===
In the year 121 of the [[Fourth Age]], after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of a broken heart at [[Cerin Amroth]] in Lórien,<ref name="tale" /> and was [[Arwen's Grave|buried there]] one year after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122 years. She was 2901 years old.

==Etymology==
The name ''Arwen'' means "Noble maiden", from [[Sindarin]] ''ar(a)'' ("royal, noble") and ''wen'' ("maiden"). Her [[epessë]] '''Undómiel''' means "Evenstar", from the [[Quenya]] ''Undómë'' ("evening twilight") and ''el'' ("star").<ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Appendix: Elements in Quenya and Sindarin names</ref>

==Character==
Arwen was described to be the most beautiful of the last generation of High Elves in Middle-earth, and was even said to bear a remarkable resemblance to her ancestress, [[Lúthien]]. Tolkien described Arwen as following:

{{blockquote|In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring.|[[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' "[[Many Meetings]]"}}

==Lineage==
Arwen was the youngest child of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]]; her elder brothers were the twins [[Elladan and Elrohir]]. Through her father, she was the granddaughter of [[Eärendil]] the Mariner (the second of the [[Half-elven|Half-Elven]]), great-granddaughter of [[Tuor]] of [[Gondolin]], and therefore a direct descendant of the ancient House of [[Hador]]. Arwen was also a descendant of King [[Turgon]] of the [[Ñoldor]] through her great-grandmother, [[Idril]]. Through her mother, she was the granddaughter of the Lady [[Galadriel]] and the great-granddaughter of [[Finarfin]]. [[Éomer]] of [[Rohan]] said that the Lady Arwen was more fair than the Lady Galadriel of [[Lórien]], but [[Gimli]] son of [[Glóin]] thought differently. Through both of her parents Arwen was a direct descendant of the ancient Elven House of [[Finwë]]. Furthermore, Arwen was a descendant of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, whose story resembled hers. Indeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her ancestress Lúthien, fairest of all the [[Elves]], who was called Nightingale (Tinúviel).
[[File:Elrond and Arwen.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|[[Elrond]] learns of Arwen's choice to become mortal]]
Arwen was a very distant relative of her husband [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]]. Aragorn's ancestor, [[Elros]] Tar-Minyatur, the first King of [[Númenor]], was her father Elrond's brother, who chose to live as a man rather than one of the [[Eldar]]. This means that Aragorn also has very distant Elvish ancestry. Elros died in [[SA 442]], some 3240 years before Arwen was born.

Arwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of [[Arnor]].

After the War of the Ring ended, Arwen and Aragorn produced the future heir of the throne, [[Eldarion]].

By Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the Half-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves ([[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and the brothers [[Olwë]] and [[Elwë]]) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood through Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, [[Melian]], Queen of [[Doriath]], and also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and Númenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was also Melian.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:Arwen - Sword.jpg|alt=|thumb|205x205px|Arwen takes up the task of delivering Frodo to Rivendell]]
===The Lord of the Rings film trilogy===
{{Blockquote|I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone.|Arwen to Aragorn in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)]]''}}Arwen Undomiel was portrayed in [[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'', and ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'' by the American actress [[Liv Tyler]]. In the ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', it was she who met Frodo and bore him across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], instead of [[Glorfindel]], and wielded the sword "[[Hadhafang]]", which does not appear in the books.

She was not mentioned or featured in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s earlier film ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.

====Behind the scenes====

In ''The Two Towers'' film, Arwen was originally supposed to appear with the host of [[Elves]] and fight at [[Helm's Deep]] alongside [[Aragorn]]. This was later cut from the film.[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Arwen.jpg|thumb|right]]

===Other appearances===

*Arwen was voiced by [[Sonia Fraser]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|(1981 radio series)]] was by [[Kath Soucie]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|(video game)]]. In the fan film ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'', Arwen is played by [[Rita Ramnani]].  In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', Arwen is a playable hero through a DLC.

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from [[Rivendell]] into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for [[Aragorn]] and bid the player to deliver to [[Halbarad]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], her prominence increases as [[Elrond]] and his household travel to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding. On their way towards [[Lothlorien|Lothlórien]] from the lands of the [[Beornings]], Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother [[Celebrian]] was tormented by [[orcs]] before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady [[Galadriel]].
