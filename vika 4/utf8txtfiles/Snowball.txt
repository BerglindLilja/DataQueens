{{Term/Store|Snowball|Snowballs|Series, BotW|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Object|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= BotW|publisher= Piggyback|page= 332}}</ref> They are mounds of snow that often appear as hazards, usually as rolling balls that run over [[Link]]. Occasionally they also appear as harmless objects that may conceal other objects or items.

==Appearances==
==={{MM|-}}===
In {{MM}}, Snowballs appear in the [[Snowhead]] region of [[Termina]]. They commonly appear as small mounds of snow on the ground, which can be destroyed and may be hiding items underneath, such as [[Heart]]s. During the winter, the [[Goron Elder]] can be found covered in a large Snowball on the surface of the lake leading to the [[Goron Village]], and is frozen underneath. If he is ignored, his Snowball will continue to grow as the days pass.

Giant Snowballs also appear as hazards in [[Snowhead Mountain]], which roll down from the mountain summit and attempt to crush Link as he is climbing the mountain. Wooden poles on the mountain path will block the path of some of the Snowballs, causing them to break away. 

==={{FSA|-}}===
In {{FSA}}, Snowballs appear as hazards in the [[Frozen Hyrule (Stage)|Frozen Hyrule]] stage. They either appear as rolling balls that move in a set path, or stand still until they are approached, when they will move after the Links, seemingly with minds of their own. They can be dispatched by using the [[Fire Rod]]. 

==={{TFH|-}}===
In {{TFH}}, Snowballs are found in [[Snowball Ravine]] and the [[Ice Temple]]. They roll along a predetermined path, but they are so huge that it can sometimes be difficult to avoid them. However, they can be melted with the [[Fire Gloves]] to a fifth of their former size. They can then be evaded much more easily, or broken with the [[Sword]] or another fireball. Occasionally, instead of Snowballs, a [[Boulder]] will roll along the path instead, which cannot be melted or destroyed. Mounds of snow also appear, which can be broken with several hits of the Sword, or a single fireball. These may contain [[Heart]]s, [[Rupee]]s, and sometimes blue [[Rat]]s.

In the "[[Drablands Challenge#Don't get hit by snowballs!|Don't get hit by snowballs!]]" [[Drablands Challenge]], Snowballs will repeatedly fall from the sky above throughout the entire Level. These Snowballs must be avoided, however there is no large penalty if the [[Links]] are hit by them, as they will only cause some damage.

==={{BotW|-}}===
Snowballs appear in the Hebra regions.  They can be pushed around and picked up by link.  Rolling a snowball into a door is required in order to access two shrines in the region.  Snowballs will begin to melt and get smaller if a fire is nearby.

==Other Appearances==

[[File:Snowball Icon CD-i.png]]
In {{TFoE}}, Snowballs appear as items [[Link]] can throw at fire-based enemies. [[Fire Daira]]s and [[Phyrandaii]]s can only be defeated by throwing a Snowball at them, as any other attack will have no effect on them. Link can obtain Snowballs by defeating certain enemies, usually [[Moblin]]s and [[Abominom]]s, in [[Nortinka]] and [[Serigon Caves]]. Link can carry up to 99 of them.
