==Biography==
Anly is the owner of the [[Lakeside Stable]] in [[West Necluda]]. When spoken to at the front of the stable, he'll welcome {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} and ask if he wants to register or take out a {{Term|BotW|Horse|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Welcome! Welcome to our fine {{Color|BotW Blue|stable}}! Do you want to register a horse? Take one out for a ride?|Anly|BotW}}</ref> When Link takes a Horse out, Anly thanks him for choosing their {{Term|BotW|Stable|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|And there you go! Thanks for choosing us for all your horsey needs.|Anly|BotW}}</ref>

If Link asks to register a horse without one present, Anly will call him a comedian, saying to "quit horsing around" and to find a horse.<ref>{{Cite|Oh... I see we have a comedian in our midst. Quit horsing around, and get around to finding a horse!|Anly|BotW}}</ref> When Link approaches the {{Term|BotW|Stable}} with a wild Horse, Anly asks if he wants to register it or rest for a while.<ref>{{Cite|Welcome to our {{Color|BotW Blue|stable}}. If you've come with a wild horse, you can register it with us here. Or if you want to stay for a {{Color|BotW Red|rest}}, please head to the counter inside.|Anly|BotW}}</ref> He explains that the Stable charges a registration fee of 20 {{Plural|BotW|Rupee|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|We charge a registration fee to help support our conservation efforts. The fee also gets you a locally made {{Color|BotW Blue|saddle}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|bridle}} for your horse. The fee is {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}}.

Would you like to take your new horse with you?|Anly|BotW}}</ref>

When attempting to register a {{Term|BotW|Deer|link}} or {{Term|BotW|Bear|link}}, Anly will scold Link and say they only register Horses.<ref>{{Cite|Not a problem. Let me just— Oh, for the love of Hylia... That's not a horse! We only board horses here, stranger. No exceptions.|Anly|BotW}}</ref> Anly insists that {{Plural|BotW|Stalhorse|link}} are monsters, and he won't board it in fear of it eating the other Horses.<ref>{{Cite|What in Hylia's name?! That's a monster, not a horse! Sorry, but we can't board that...thing here. It might eat the other horses.|Anly|BotW}}</ref> If Link tries to register the {{Term|BotW|Lord of the Mountain|link}}, Anly refuses, believing they'll all by cursed.<ref>{{Cite|Understoo— Uh... Wh-what is that? Can that...THING you're riding be the fabled Lord of the Mountain?! Why in Hylia's name would you bring something like that here? We'll all be cursed!|Anly|BotW}}</ref>

Anly gives Link several tips for taking care of Horses, such as instructions on how to tame a wild horse.<ref>{{Cite|To catch a wild horse, slowly approach it from behind and hop on—got it?|Anly|BotW}}</ref> He also tells Link that, if he's separated from his horse, whistling will cause it to come running.<ref>{{Cite|If you get separated from your horse, you can whistle and it will come running! But your horse isn't magic. It can't hear you if you're too far away, so do keep that in mind!|Anly|BotW}}</ref>

Inside the stable, he will once again welcome Link and ask if he'll be staying with them.<ref>{{Cite|Welcome!<br>Will you be staying with us?|Anly|BotW}}</ref> He offers regular beds for 20 Rupees and a soft bed for 40 Rupees.<ref>{{Cite|A regular bed will cost you {{Color|BotW Red|20 rupees}}.

It costs more than the regular bed, but you'll wake up more energized.|Anly|BotW}}</ref>

Before Link rests, Anly tells him to sleep well.<ref>{{Cite|Sleep well!|Anly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|OK. Rest well!|Anly|BotW}}</ref> When Link wakes up, Anly wishes him a good morning, day, or evening and hopes he enjoyed his stay.<ref>{{Cite|Good morning.<br>I hope you enjoyed your stay!|Anly|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I hope you enjoyed your stay.
