}}'''Déagol''', also known as '''Nahald''', was a [[Stoor]]-[[hobbit]] of the [[Gladden Fields|Gladden Fields.]] Déagol was the cousin and best [[Friendship|friend]] of [[Sméagol]] until his discovery of the [[One Ring|Ring]].

== Biography ==

[[File:Deagol.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Déagol having found the One Ring]]

Déagol was born some time between TA 2400 and [[TA 2430]]. Déagol and Sméagol apparently lived in an extended family under a [[Matriarch]]. He became the third [[Ring-bearer|bearer]] of the One Ring, after [[Isildur]], when he found it in the [[Gladden]] river (a tributary to the [[Anduin]]) with his cousin Sméagol. On Sméagol's birthday in [[TA 2463]] they went fishing (or rather Déagol fished while Sméagol dug in the earth), and a big [[fish]] pulled Déagol underwater. It was then that he discovered the One Ring, half-buried in the [[river]]-bed. When Sméagol saw the Ring, he stared at it with great desire, and then asked to keep it for his birthday. When his cousin refused, Sméagol became enraged and strangled Déagol to death, hiding the body, which was never found. This deed haunted Gollum for the rest of his life.

Of the Ring's bearers, Déagol carried it for the shortest collective time, possessing it only for no more than a few minutes. By contrast, the next shortest, [[Samwise Gamgee]], carried it for a full day, and all the other Ring-bearers held it for at least a year. Déagol was also the only Ring-bearer never to use the Ring, all the others making use of its gift of invisibility at least once.

It was possible that the Ring had already affected Déagol in a way that made him desire to keep it, explaining his unwillingness to give it to Sméagol.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter II: "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"</ref>

== Etymology ==

''Déagol'' is in fact an [[Old English language|Old English]] translation of the character's [[Westron]] name ''Nahald''. Both names bear the meaning "Apt to hide" or "secretive".<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix F]], "On Translation"</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== Films ===

Déagol appears in the beginning of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', voiced by [[Anthony Daniels]].

Déagol is fully seen in the third installment of [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy| film trilogy]],[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|'' The Return of the King'']]''. ''He is played by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Thomas Robins]]. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', only his hand appears, picking up the Ring in the Gladden River.
