It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others. And into this Ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

“One Ring to rule them all.”

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted.  A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. 

Victory was near. But the power of the Ring could not be undone.

It was in this moment when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father’s sword.
 
Sauron, the enemy of the free-peoples of Middle-Earth was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. 
 
But the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. 
 
It betrayed Isildur to his death… 
 
And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. 
History became legend, legend became myth and for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. 
Gollum: My Precioussssssss 
The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there, it consumed him. 

Gollum: It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my prrrecioussssss!
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forest of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the east, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived. Its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.

But something happened then the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. 

Bilbo: What’s this?
A Hobbit: Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. 
Bilbo: A ring.
Gollum:  Lossssst! My precious is lost!

For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

Text: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING


Text: The Shire…60 years later

Gandalf: The road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow if I can… 

Frodo: You’re late!


Gandalf: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. 


Frodo: Its wonderful to see you Gandalf!
Gandalf: Ooh! You didn’t think I’d miss your Uncle Bilbo’s birthday?


Frodo: What news of the outside world? Tell me everything.
Gandalf: Everything? Far too eager and curious for a hobbit, most unnatural. Well what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past age, full of its own comings and goings. Scarcely aware of the existence of hobbits… which I am very thankful.
Hobbit folk: Look it’s Gandalf! It’s Gandalf!


Gandalf: Ohh! The long expected party!


Gandalf: So how is the old rascal? I hear it’s going to be a party of special magnificence.
Frodo: You know Bilbo, he’s got the whole place in an uproar.

Gandalf: Hmmm, well now that should please him, hmmm.
Frodo: Half the Shire’s been invited.
Gandalf: Good gracious me! 
Frodo: He is up to something. 
Gandalf: Oh really.. 
Frodo: All right then keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of. 
Gandalf: Indeed?
Frodo: Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. 
Gandalf: If you’re referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. 
Frodo: Whatever you did, you’ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. 
Gandalf: Oh really? 

Hobbit children: Gandalf! Gandalf! 

Hobbit children: Fireworks?!? Gandalf?!?

Hobbit children: Awwwww.

Frodo: Gandalf, I’m glad you’re back.
Gandalf: So am I, dear boy! So am I.

Bilbo: No thank you! We don’t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
Gandalf: And what about very old friends? 

Bilbo: Gandalf? 
Gandalf: Bilbo Baggins! 
Bilbo: My dear Gandalf! 

Gandalf: Good to see you! One hundred and eleven years old –who would believe it? You haven’t aged a day.

Bilbo: Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome! 

Bilbo: Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger? I’ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296 –very good year. Almost as old as I am! Hahaha! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? 
Gandalf: Just tea, thank you.
 
Bilbo: I was expecting you here last week! Not that it matters, you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared, I’m afraid. We have some cold chicken and pickles… Here’s some cheese here- oh no it won’t do. There we got raspberry jam and apple tart… Not much for afterlunch – oh no! We’re all right. I have some cake.  I can make you some eggs if you like- oh. Gandalf? 

Gandalf: Just tea, thank you. 
Bilbo: Ah right. You don’t mind if I eat, do you? 
Gandalf: Oh no, not at all. 

Lobelia: “Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!”

Bilbo: I’m not at home! 

Bilbo: I’ve got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell–they never give me a moment’s peace! I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!


Gandalf: So, you mean to go through with your plan, then. 
Bilbo: Yes, yes. It’s all in hand. All the arrangements are made.  Oh, thank you. 
Gandalf: Frodo suspects something. 

Bilbo: ‘Course he does. He’s a Baggins! Not some block-headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. 
Gandalf: You will tell him, won’t you? 
Bilbo: Yes, yes. 
Gandalf: He’s very fond of you. 
Bilbo: I know. He’d probably come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart Frodo is still in love with the Shire: the woods, the fields…little rivers. I’m old Gandalf. I know I don’t look it, but I’m beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin…sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday, and I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.

Bilbo: Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

Bilbo: Gandalf, my old friend. This will be a night to remember! 

Bilbo: Hello, hello, Fatty Bolger, lovely to see you! Welcome, welcome!

Frodo: Go on Sam! Ask Rosie for a dance.
Sam: I think I’ll just have another ale. 
Frodo: Oh no you don’t. Go on. 

Gandalf: Whoa! 

Bilbo: So there I was, at the mercy of three monstrous trolls! And they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us, whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly. 

Bilbo: They spent so much time arguing the wither-tos and why-fors, that when the sun’s first light cracked over the top of the trees and poof!

Hobbit Children: 
Bilbo: And turned them all to stone!

Merry: Quickly! 

Gandalf: Whoa! Up they go. 

Merry: No, no the big one, big one 

Pippin: Done.
Merry: You’re supposed to stick it in the ground! 

Pippin: It is in the ground. 

Merry: Outside! 

Pippin: It was your idea!

Hobbit: Look at that!

Frodo: Bilbo? Bilbo, look out for the dragon! 
Bilbo: Dragon? Nonsense! There hasn’t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years…

Merry: That was good!
Pippin: Let’s get another one! 

Merry and Pippin: Aah!
Gandalf: Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might’ve known. 

Hobbits: Speech, Bilbo! Speech! 

Frodo: Speech! 

Bilbo: My dear Bagginses and Boffins, Tooks and Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots. 
Proudfoot Hobbit: Proudfeet!

Bilbo: Proudfoots.
Bilbo: Today is my 111th birthday! 
Hobbits: Happy birthday! 
Hobbit: Happy birthday! 
Bilbo: Alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like, and
I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. 

Bilbo: I, uh, I h-have things to do.  I regret to announce this is the end. I am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. 

Hobbits: Ohh! 
 
Bilbo: Hahahahaha! 

Gandalf: I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Bilbo: Come on Gandalf! Did you see their faces? 
Gandalf: There are many magic rings in this world Bilbo Baggins and none of them should be used lightly. 
Bilbo: It was just a bit of fun! Oh you’re probably right, as usual. You will keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you? 

Gandalf: Two eyes, as often as I can spare them. 
Bilbo: I’m leaving everything to him. 
Gandalf: What about this Ring of yours, is that staying too? 
Bilbo: Yes, yes. It’s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. 
Bilbo: No, wait, it’s… here in my pocket. Heh, isn’t that, isn’t that odd though? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn’t I keep it? 
Gandalf: I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? 
Bilbo: Well no… And yes! Now it comes to it, I don’t feel like parting with it, its mine, I found it, it came to me! 
Gandalf: There’s no need to get angry. 

Bilbo: Well if I’m angry, it’s your fault! It’s mine! My own, my precious. 
Gandalf: Precious? Its been called that before, but not by you. 
Bilbo: Argh! What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!
Gandalf: I think you’ve had that Ring quite long enough. 
Bilbo: You want it for yourself! 

Gandalf: Bilbo Baggins!  Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I’m trying to help you. 

Gandalf: All your long years we’ve been friends. Trust me as you once did, hmm? Let it go. 
Bilbo: You’re right Gandalf, the Ring must go to Frodo. It’s late, the road is long. Yes it is time. 

Gandalf: Bilbo…

Bilbo: Hmm?
Gandalf: …the Ring is still in your pocket. 
Bilbo: Oh, yes… 

Bilbo: I’ve thought of an ending for my book. “And he lived happily ever after…to the end of his days”. 
Gandalf: And I’m sure you will my dear friend. 
Bilbo: Good bye, Gandalf. 
Gandalf: Good bye, dear Bilbo. 

Bilbo: The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began…
Gandalf: Until our next meeting.

 It’s mine, my own, my precious!
Gandalf:  Riddles in the Dark.


Frodo: Bilbo! Bilbo! 

Gandalf: My precious… Precious…

Frodo: He’s gone hasn’t he? He talked for so long about leaving. I didn’t think he’d really do it. 

Frodo: Gandalf? 
Gandalf: Hmm.  Bilbo’s Ring. He’s gone to stay with the Elves. He’s left you Bag End… 
 
…along with all his possessions. The Ring is yours now. Put it somewhere out of sight.

Frodo: Where are you going? 
Gandalf: There are some things that I must see to. 
Frodo: What things? 
Gandalf: Questions. Questions that need answering! 
Frodo: But you’ve only just arrived! I don’t understand. 

Gandalf: Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. 

Gollum: Shire!!! Baggins!!! 
(Gates of Minas Morgul open and the Ringwraiths ride out.
Gandalf has ridden through Rohan. He stops his horse, seeing the mountains of Ephel Dûath, the borders of Mordor, looming in the distance, lightning flashes behind and above. He understands that something is happening. He then heads for Minas Tirith. In the library there, he finds what he is seeking)
Gandalf: Year 3434 of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor and the finding of the Ring of Power. It has come to me, the One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All that should follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for I will risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me, though I buy it with a great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell.

Ringwraith: Shire. Baggins.
Hobbit: Baggins. There are no Baggins ‘round here. They’re up in Hobbiton, that way. 

Rosie: Goodnight. 
Sam: Goodnight. 

Sam: Goodnight.
Frodo: Goodnight Sam. 

Frodo: Huh?! 
Gandalf: Is it secret?! Is it safe?!

Frodo: Ah! 

Frodo: What are you doing? 

Gandalf: Hold out your hand Frodo, it’s quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything? 
Frodo: Nothing. There’s nothing… Wait. There are markings. It’s some form of elvish. I can’t read it.
Gandalf: There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. 
Frodo: Mordor..? 
Gandalf: In the common tongue it says, “One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them. One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” 

Gandalf: This is the One Ring. Forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself. 
Frodo: Bilbo found it. In Gollum’s cave. 

Gandalf: Yes. For sixty years the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It’s heard its master’s call. 
Frodo: But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.
Ring:  Isildur…

Gandalf: No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it. 

Frodo: Alright, we put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it’s here, do they? Do they, Gandalf? 

Gandalf: There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first. I don’t know how long they tortured him. Amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: 

Gollum: Shire!!! Aah!!! Baggins!!! 
Frodo: Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here!

Hobbit: Who goes there?

Frodo: Take it Gandalf! Take it! 
Gandalf: No Frodo no! 
Frodo: You must take it! 
Gandalf: You cannot offer me this Ring! 
Frodo: I’m giving it to you! 
Gandalf: Don’t tempt me Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo, I would use this Ring from the desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
Frodo: But it cannot stay in the Shire! 

Gandalf: No! No it can’t. 
Frodo: What must I do?

Gandalf: You must leave and leave quickly. 
Frodo: Where? Where do I go? 
Gandalf: Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree. 
Frodo: Bree. What about you? 
Gandalf: I’ll be waiting for you, at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. 
Frodo: And the Ring will be safe there? 
Gandalf: I don’t know Frodo. I don’t have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me Frodo, he’ll know what to do. You’ll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you, for that name is not safe outside the Shire. Travel only by day. And stay off the road. 
Frodo: I can cut across country easily enough. 
Gandalf: My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures! You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.  Get down! 

Sam: Oooff!! 
Gandalf: Confound it all Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?!
Sam: I have been droppin’ no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me. 
Gandalf: A little late for trimming the verge don’t you think? 
Sam: I heard raised voices. 

Gandalf: What did you hear?! Speak!!!! 
Sam: N-n-n-nothing important. That is I heard a good deal about a Ring and a Dark Lord and something about the end of the world but… Please, Mister Gandalf sir, don’t hurt me. Don’t turn me into anythin’…. unnatural. 
Gandalf: No, perhaps not. I have thought of a better use for you…

Gandalf: Come along Samwise, keep up! Be careful both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on, for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found.


Sam: This is it.
Frodo: This is what? 
Sam: I take one more step, it’ll be the farthest away from home I’ve ever been. 
Frodo: Come on Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say: “It’s a dangerous business… …Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.”

Saruman: Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom. The hour grows late and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not?..my old friend. 
Gandalf: Saruman.

Saruman: You are sure of this? 
Gandalf: Beyond any doubt. 
Saruman: The Ring of Power has been found. 
Gandalf: All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose. 
Saruman: Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling’s leaf has clearly slowed your mind. 
Gandalf: But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly. 
Saruman: Time?! What time do you think we have?

Saruman: Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf; a great Eye… lidless… wreathed in flame. 
Gandalf: The Eye of Sauron.
Saruman: He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon he will summon an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle Earth. 
Gandalf: You know this? How? 
Saruman: I have seen it.

Gandalf: A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman. 
Saruman: Why? Why should we fear to use it? 

Gandalf: They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing Stones. We do not know who else may be watching! 

Saruman: The hour is later than you think. Sauron’s forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. 
Gandalf: The Nine!
Saruman: They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer’s Eve, disguised as riders in black. 
Gandalf: They’ve reached the Shire?! 
Saruman: They will find the Ring… and kill the one who carries it. 
Gandalf: Frodo! 

Saruman: You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron. There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.
Gandalf: Tell me, “friend”, when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?!

Saruman: I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. But you…have elected…the way of pain! 


Sam: Mr. Frodo? Frodo! Frodo! 

Sam: I thought I’d lost you. 
Frodo: What are you talking about? 
Sam: It’s just something Gandalf said. 
Frodo: What did he say? 
Sam: “Don’t you lose him Samwise Gamgee!” And I don’t mean to. 
Frodo: Sam, we’re still in the Shire. What could possibly happen? 

Pippin: Frodo? Merry! It’s Frodo Baggins. 
Merry: Hello Frodo! 
Sam: Get off him!  Frodo? Are you all right? 
Pippin: What’s the meaning of this? 
Merry: Hold this.  

Sam: You’ve been into Farmer Maggot’s crop! 

Farmer Maggot: Wait till I get this through you! Stay out of my fields! You ruffians, I’ll catch up with you! 
Merry: ‘Dunno why he is so upset. It’s only a couple of carrots!
Pippin: And some cabbages. And those few bags of potatoes that we lifted last week and, and the mushrooms the week before! 
Merry: Yes Pippin! My point is, he is clearly overreacting. Run! 

Pippin: Ohh! That was close 
Merry: Oww! I think I’ve broken something. 
Sam: Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! 
Merry: What? That was just a detour, a shortcut. 
Sam: A shortcut to what? 
Pippin: Mushrooms!

Pippin: That’s mine!
Hobbits: Mmmm..
Merry: Here is a nice one Sam.
Frodo: I think we should get off the road.

Frodo: Get off the road! Quick!


Sam: Shhh! Stop it! Be quiet!

Merry: What was that?

Pippin: Anything?
Frodo: Nothing. 
Pippin: What is going on? 
Merry: That Black Rider was looking for something… or someone. Frodo? 
Pippin: Get down!

Frodo: I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. 
Merry: Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me. 

Pippin: Run! This way, follow me! Run!
Merry: Get the rope Sam!
Sam: Frodo!
Hobbits: Run Frodo!
Frodo: Go!
Hobbits: Hurry!
Sam: Frodo!
Hobbits: Jump Frodo! Go on faster! Jump!

Frodo: How far to the nearest crossing?
Merry: Brandywine Bridge: Twenty miles.

Frodo: Come on.
Gatekeeper: What do you want?
Frodo: We’re heading for the Prancing Pony. 
Gatekeeper: Hobbits! Four hobbits! What business brings you to Bree? 
Frodo: We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.
Gatekeeper: Alright young sir, I meant no offense. It’s my job to ask questions after nightfall. There’s talk of strange folk abroad. Can’t be too careful. 
 
Men of Bree: Out of the Way! Watch where you’re going! 

Frodo: Excuse me?
Butterbur: Good evening little masters! If you’re seeking accommodation we’ve got some nice, cozy, hobbit-sized rooms available. Mr. Uh….
Frodo: …Underhill, my name’s Underhill. 
Butterbur: Underhill. Yes. 
Frodo: We’re friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we’ve arrived? 
Butterbur: Gandalf? Gandalf? Ohh yes! I remember, elderly chap, big gray beard, pointy hat.  Not seen him for 6 months. 
Sam: What do we do now?

Frodo: Sam. He’ll be here. He’ll come. 
Man:  Get out of my way.

Pippin: What’s that? 
Merry: This my friend, is a pint.

Pippin: It comes in pints? I’m getting one. 

Sam: You had a whole half already! 


Sam: That fellow’s done nothin’ but stare at you since we arrived.
Frodo:  Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he? 
Butterbur: He’s one of them rangers. Dangerous folk they are.. wandering in the wild. What his right name is I’ve never heard but around here, he’s known as Strider.
Frodo: Strider…

The Ring: Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins! Baggins!
Pippin: Baggins!


Pippin:  Sure I know a Baggins. He’s over there, Frodo Baggins. He’s my second cousin once removed on his mother’s side and my third cousin twice removed on his father’s side, if you follow me.

Frodo: Pippin! 
Pippin: Steady on! 

Voice of Sauron: You cannot hide! I see you! There is no life in the void…only death…

Frodo: Ah!

Strider: You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr. “Underhill”! 

Frodo: What do you want? 
Strider: A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. 
Frodo: I carry nothing. 
Strider: Indeed. 
Strider: I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. 
Frodo: Who are you? 
Strider: Are you frightened? 
Frodo: Yes. 
Strider: Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.

Sam: Let him go! Or I’ll have you, Longshanks! 
Strider: You have a stout heart little hobbit, but that will not save you. You are no longer with the wizard Frodo. They’re coming.

Frodo: What are they? 
Strider: They were once men. Great Kings of Men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine Rings of Power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness.  Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazgûl, Ringwraiths, neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring. Drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.

Frodo: Where are you taking us?
Strider: Into the wild. 
Merry: How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? 
Frodo: We have no choice but to trust him. 
Sam: But where is he leading us? 
Strider: To Rivendell Master Gamgee, The House of Elrond. 
Sam: Did you hear that? Rivendell! We’re going to see the elves!

Strider: Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. 
Pippin: What about breakfast? 
Strider: We’ve already had it. 
Pippin: We’ve had one yes. What about second breakfast?


Merry: Don’t think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. 
Pippin: What about elevensees? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them, doesn’t he? 
Merry: I wouldn’t count on it. 

Merry: Pippin!

Saruman:  The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth. 
Voice of Sauron: Build me an army worthy of Mordor! 

Orc: What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? 
Saruman: We have work to do! 

Orcs: The trees are strong, my Lord. Their roots go deep. 
Saruman: Rip them all down.

Strider: This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl. We shall rest here tonight. 

Strider: These are for you. Keep them close. I’m going to have a look around. Stay here.


Pippin: Can I have some meat? 
Merry: Ok. Want some tomatoes Sam? 
Merry: Great tomatoes
Frodo: What are you doing?! 
Merry: Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. 
Sam: We saved some for you Mr. Frodo. 
Frodo: Put it out you fools! Put it out! 
Pippin: Oh that’s nice! Ash on my tomatoes! 

All: Uh?! 

Frodo: Go! 
 
Sam: Back you devils!
(A Nazgûl hits Sam’s sword, then throws him aside. He hits a stone hard, and lies in a huddle on the ground. Merry and Pippin realize that the Nazgûl are after Frodo and the Ring, and stand in front of him, trying to guard him. Two Nazgûl grab them and throw them in each direction. Frodo backs off, drops his sword, and then falls backwards. He hears the Ring whisper, and takes it out of his pocket. The Witch King “sees” this, draws his dagger and walks towards him. Frodo tries to crawl backwards, but the wall stops him. Trapped in a corner, the Witch King comes closer, and almost stabs him, when Frodo puts on the Ring.
His world changes to a whirling mist, and he sees the Nazgûl for what they are. The Witch King reaches for Frodo’s hand, but Frodo draws it back, and so the Witch King stabs him in his left shoulder with his dagger. Frodo screams, then the Witch King draws out the dagger and reaches for the Ring again. Suddenly, a shadow from the left is seen and the Witch King backs off. Frodo manages to take of the Ring and appears back in the “real” world)
Frodo: Aaaahhhh!
Sam: Frodo! 
Frodo: Oh Sam!

Sam: Strider! Help him Strider. 
Strider: He’s been stabbed by a Morgul blade.  This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine.

Strider: Hurry!
Sam: We are six days from Rivendell. He’ll never make it!
Frodo: Gandalf…
Strider: Hold on Frodo. 
Frodo: …Gandalf!
 
Gandalf:  Gwaihir. Go, Gwaihir.
(Gandalf lifts his hand and the moth flies away. Camera flies down into the Caverns of Isengard as forging of weapons and armor is done. Saruman walks around, observing all the activity with pride and witnesses the birth of Lurtz and the Uruk Hai.
Strider and the Hobbits are in the Trollshaws)
Sam: Mr. Frodo?  He’s going cold!
Pippin: Is he going to die? 
Strider: He’s passing into the shadow world. He will soon become a wraith like them.

Merry: They’re close.
Strider: Sam, do you know Athelas plant? 
Sam: Athelas? 
Strider: Kingsfoil.
Sam: Kingsfoil? Ah, that’s a weed.
Strider: It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

Arwen: What’s this? A ranger caught off his guard? 


Arwen: Frodo… Im Arwen. Telin le thaed *I am Arwen. I have come to help you* 
Arwen: Lasto beth nin. Tolo dan na galad *Hear my voice. Come back to the light*
Merry: Who is she?
Arwen:  Frodo!
Sam: She’s an Elf. 
Arwen: He’s fading! 

Arwen:  He’s not going to last. We must get him to my father. I’ve been looking for you for two days. 
Merry: Where are you taking him?


Arwen: There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.

Strider: Dartho guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon. *Stay with the Hobbits. I will send horses again for you*
Arwen: Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. *I’m the faster rider. I’ll take him*
Strider: Andelu i ven. *The road is too dangerous*
Pippin: What are they saying? 
Arwen: Frodo fir. Ae athradon i hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon. *Frodo dies. If I can get across the river, the power of my people will protect him.*
Arwen: I do not fear them.
Strider: Beyest lin. *According to your wish*

Strider: Arwen! Ride hard. Don’t look back! 
Arwen: Noro lim, Asfaloth, noro lim! *Ride fast Asfaloth, ride fast!*

Sam:  What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there! 


Arwen: Noro lim Asfaloth! *Ride faster Asfaloth!*
 
Nazgûl: Give up the halfling, she-elf! 
Arwen:  If you want him, come and claim him! 

Arwen: Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulair! Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen dan in Ulair! *Waters of the Misty Mountains listen to the great word; flow waters of Loudwater against the Ringwraiths!*
(Slowly, the water level rises. A great sound is heard, and everyone turns towards it. A great flood comes around a bend, with peaks like horses galopping. The Nazgûl try to get away, some try to get back to the bank and some flee down the river, but in vain. The flood gets them all and washes them away.
Arwen looks after them, when Frodo starts to fall from Asfaloth. Arwen lays him on the ground)
Arwen: No! Frodo.. No! Frodo, don’t give in! Not now!

Arwen:  What grace is given me, let it pass to him… Let him be spared… Save him.

Elrond: Lasto beth nin. Tolo dan nan galad. *Hear my voice, come back to the light*

Frodo:  Where am I? 
Gandalf: You are in the house of Elrond. And it is 10 o’clock in the morning, on October the 24th if you want to know. 

Frodo: Gandalf! 
Gandalf: Yes. I’m here. And you’re lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! 
Frodo: What happened Gandalf? Why didn’t you meet us? 
Gandalf: Oh, I am sorry Frodo…. I was delayed. 

Saruman: Friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
Saruman: One ill turn deserves another. It is over! Embrace the power of the Ring…or embrace your own destruction! 

Gandalf:  There is only one Lord of the Ring! Only one can bend it to his will. And he does not share power!

Saruman: So you have chosen…death.




Frodo: Gandalf? What is it? 
Gandalf: Nothing Frodo. 

Sam: Frodo! Frodo! 
Frodo: Sam!
Sam: Bless you, you’re awake!

Gandalf: Sam has hardly left your side. 
Sam: We were that worried about you, weren’t we Mr. Gandalf? 

Gandalf: By the skills of Lord Elrond, you’re beginning to mend. 

Elrond: Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. 

Frodo: Bilbo! 

Bilbo: Hello Frodo my lad! 
Frodo: Bilbo! 

Frodo: “There and Back Again: A Hobbit’s Tale by Bilbo Baggins”.  This is wonderful!

Bilbo: I meant to go back…wander the powers of Mirkwood… visit Laketown…see the Lonely Mountain again. But age it seems have finally caught up with me. 

Frodo: I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood, pretending I was off somewhere else.. Off with you on one of your adventures! My own adventure turned out to be quite different. 
Frodo: I’m not like you, Bilbo.
Bilbo: My dear boy. 


Sam:  Now what have I forgotten?

Frodo: Packed already? 
Sam: No harm in being prepared. 
Frodo: I thought you wanted to see the Elves Sam. 
Sam: I do! 
Frodo: More than anything.
Sam: I did! It’s just…we did what Gandalf wanted didn’t we? We got the Ring this far to Rivendell, and I thought, seeing as how you’re on the mend, we’d be off soon. Off home. 
Frodo: You’re right Sam. We did what we set out to do.  The Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home.

Elrond: His strength returns. 
Gandalf: That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. 
Elrond: And yet to have come so far, still bearing the Ring, the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to it’s evil. 
Gandalf: It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo. 
Elrond: Gandalf, the Enemy is moving. Sauron’s forces are massing in the east– his eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman you tell me has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.
Gandalf: His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft Saruman has crossed orcs with goblinmen, he’s breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. 
Elrond: This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

Elrond: Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here. 
 
Elrond: This peril belongs to all Middle Earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the Elves is over- my people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we’ve gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.

Gandalf: It is in Men that we must place our hope. 
Elrond: Men? Men are weak.  The race of men is failing. The blood of Númenor is all but spent. Its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago…



Elrond: Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed. 

Elrond: Isildur hurry. Follow me. 

Elrond:  I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. 

Elrond: Cast it into the fire!

Elrond: Destroy it!
Isildur:  No…

Elrond: Isildur!!!
Elrond:  It should’ve ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. 
 
Elrond: Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken. There is no strength left in the world of men. They’re scattered, divided, leaderless. 
Gandalf: There is one who could unite them, one who could reclaim the throne of Gondor. 
Elrond: He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.

Boromir: The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut the ring from Sauron’s hand! 

Boromir:  It’s still sharp! 

Boromir: But no more than a broken heirloom! 

Arwen: Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur’s heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.
Aragorn: The same blood flows in my veins.  Same weakness. 

Arwen: Your time will come. You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it. A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor. Ú or le a ú or nin. *The Shadow does not hold sway yet, not over you and not over me.*

Arwen: Renech i lu i erui govannen? *Do you remember when we first met?*
Aragorn: Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen. *I thought I had strayed into a dream.*
Arwen:  Gwenwin in enninath…U-arnech in naeth i si celich. Renech i beth i pennen? *Long years have passed…You did not have the cares you carry now. Do you remember what I told you?*
Aragorn:  You said you’d bind yourself to me. Forsaking the immortal life of your people. 
Arwen: And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. 

Arwen: I choose a mortal life. 
Aragorn: You cannot give me this! 
Arwen: It is mine to give to whom I will… like my heart. 



Elrond: Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate–this one doom.  Bring forth the Ring, Frodo. 
 
Boromir: So it is true… 
Someone whispers: The Doom of Man 
Boromir: It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring?  Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe! Give Gondor the weapon of the Enemy. Let us use it against him! 
Aragorn: You cannot wield it! None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.
Boromir: And what would a ranger know of this matter? 

Legolas: This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. 
Boromir: Aragorn?  This… is Isildur’s heir? 
Legolas: And heir to the throne of Gondor. 

Aragorn: Havo dad Legolas *Sit down Legolas*
Boromir: Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. 
Gandalf: Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. 
Elrond: You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed. 
Gimli: What are we waiting for?

Gimli: ARGH!!

Elrond: The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. 
Ring:  Ash Nazg

Elrond: One of you must do this.

 
Boromir: One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. And the great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly! 
Legolas:  Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed! 

Gimli:  And I suppose you think you’re the one to do it?! 
Boromir:  And if we fail, what then?! What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?! 
Gimli: I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! 

Gimli: Never trust an Elf! 
Gandalf:  Do you not understand that while we bicker among ourselves, Sauron’s power grows?! None can escape it! 
Man: You’ll all be destroyed!

Ring: Ash Nazg Durbatulûk! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul!

Frodo: I will take it! I will take it!

Frodo: I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though.. I do not know the way. 
Gandalf: 
Aragorn:  If by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. 

Aragorn: You have my sword. 
Legolas: And you have my bow. 
Gimli: And my axe! 
Boromir:  You carry the fates of us all little one. If this is indeed the will of the council, then Gondor will see it done. 
Sam: Heh!  Mr. Frodo is not goin’ anywhere without me! 
Elrond:  No indeed, it is hardly possible to separate you even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. 
Pippin and Merry:  Wait! We are coming too! 
Merry: You’d have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us! 
Pippin: Anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission, quest… thing. 
Merry: Well that rules you out Pip. 
Elrond: Nine companions… So be it! You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring! 
Pippin: Great! Where are we going?


Bilbo: My old sword, Sting! Here! Take it, take it! 

Frodo: It’s so light! 
Bilbo: Yes…yes.. made by the Elves you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close. And it’s times like that my lad, when you’ll have to be extra careful!

Bilbo: Here’s a pretty thing… Mithril! As light as a feather! And as hard as dragon scales! Let me see you put it on. Go on.


Bilbo: Oh… M..my old Ring! I sh-sh-should very much like… to hold it again, one last time. 

Bilbo: Oh…I’m sorry I brought this upon you my boy…I’m sorry that you must carry this burden. I’m sorry for everything!


Gandalf: We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for 40 days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there our road turns east to Mordor.


Boromir: Two, Three, Four, Five. Good, very good.
Aragorn: Move your feet. 
Merry: That’s good, Pippin. 
Pippin: Thanks. 
Boromir: Faster 
Gimli: If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they’re not, I’d say we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. 
Gandalf: No Gimli, I would not take the roads through Moria unless I had no other choice.

Boromir: Come on. Good. 

Pippin: Aaah! 
Boromir: Sorry! 
 
Boromir: Ah!
Merry: Get him! 

Pippin: For the Shire! 
Pippin: Hold him! Hold him Merry!
Merry: He got my arm! He got my arm!

Sam: What is that? 
Gimli: Nothing, it’s just a whisp of cloud. 
Boromir: It’s moving fast… Against the wind. 
Legolas: Crebain from Dunland! 
Aragorn: Hide! 
Boromir: Merry! Frodo!
Aragorn: Come on, come on! Take cover!

Gandalf: Spies of Saruman! The passage south is being watched. We must take the Pass of Caradhras. 

Frodo: Ahh! 
Aragorn: Frodo! 

Aragorn: Boromir.
Boromir: It is a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing… Such a little thing.
Aragorn: Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo. 
Boromir:  As you wish. I care not.

Saruman: So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go? If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road? 

Saruman: Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! *Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your horn be bloodstained!*
Legolas: There is a fell voice on the air. 
Gandalf: It’s Saruman!

Aragorn: He’s trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back! 
Gandalf: No! 

Gandalf: Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i ‘ruith! *Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!*

Saruman: Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar! *Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your bloodstained horn fall upon enemy heads!*

Boromir: We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!
Aragorn: The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
Gimli: If we cannot pass over a mountain, let us go under it. Let us go through the Mines of Moria. 

Saruman: Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm… Shadow and Flame! 

Gandalf: Let the Ring-bearer decide. 
Gandalf: Frodo? 
Frodo: We will go through the mines. 
Gandalf: So be it. 

Gimli:  The walls of Moria! 

 
Frodo: 
 
Gandalf: Now, let’s see. Ithildin.. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

Gandalf: It reads “The Doors of Durin – Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.”
Merry: What do you suppose that means? 
Gandalf: Oh it’s quite simple. If you are a friend you speak the password and the doors will open.
Gandalf: Annon edhellen edro hi ammen! *Gate of the Elves open now for me!*

Gandalf: Ando Eldarinwa a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa! *Gate of Elves listen to my word, Threshold of Dwarves!*

Aragorn: The mines are no place for a pony, even one so brave as Bill. 
Sam: Buh-bye Bill
Aragorn: Go on, Bill, go on. Don’t worry Sam, he knows the way home. 

Aragorn: Do not disturb the water. 

Gandalf: Oh, it’s useless! 

Frodo: It’s a riddle. Speak “friend” and enter. What’s the Elvish word for friend? 
Gandalf: Mellon 

Gimli: Soon Master Elf you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves. Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin. And they call it a mine. A mine! 
Boromir: This is no mine, it’s a tomb! 

Gimli: Oh! No! Nooo!!! 

Legolas: Goblins!

Boromir: We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here. 

Boromir: Now get out, get out! 

Sam, Merry, and Pippin: Frodo! 
Sam: Strider! Get off him! 
 
Frodo: Aah! 
Merry: Aragorn! 

Gandalf: Into the Mines! 
Boromir: Legolas! Aim for his eye! Come on! 


Gandalf: We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.


Gandalf: Quietly now. It’s a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. 

Merry: Pippin! 

Gandalf: I have no memory of this place

Pippin: Are we lost? 
Merry: No.
Pippin: I think we are. 
Sam: Shhh! Gandalf’s thinking. 

Pippin: Merry? 
Merry: What? 
Pippin: I’m hungry. 

Frodo: There’s something down there. 
Gandalf: It’s Gollum. 

Frodo: Gollum? 
Gandalf: He’s been following us for three days. 
Frodo: He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?! 
Gandalf: Escaped…Or was set loose?


Gandalf: He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. He will never be rid of his need for it. 


Frodo: It’s a pity Bilbo didn’t kill him when he had the chance! 
Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?

Gandalf: Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise can not see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. 

Frodo: I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. 
Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. 

Gandalf: Ah! It’s that way.
Merry: He’s remembered!
Gandalf: No, but the air doesn’t smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose. 

Gandalf: Let me risk a little more light.

Gandalf: Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. 
Sam: Now there’s an eye opener, and no mistake. 

Gimli: Oh!
Gandalf: Gimli!


Gimli: No! No! Noooo! 

Gandalf: “Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.” He is dead then. It’s as I feared. 

Legolas: We must move on, we cannot linger!


Gandalf: “They have taken the bridge, and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums, drums in the deep.  We cannot get out. A Shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out…They are coming.”

Gandalf: Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity! 

Sam: Frodo! 

Legolas: Orcs! 

Aragorn: Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

Boromir: They have a cave-troll.

Gimli: Aarghhh!! Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria that still draws breath!

Sam: I think I’m getting the hang of this.
Aragorn: Frodo!

Frodo: Aragorn! Aragorn! 

Aragorn: Frodo!

Frodo: Agh!
Sam: Frodo? Frodo! 

Merry and Pippin: Yaahh! 

Aragorn: Oh no! 

Sam: He’s alive! 
Frodo: I’m all right, I’m not hurt. 
Aragorn: You should be dead! That spear would have skewered a wild boar. 
Gandalf: I think there’s more to this hobbit than meets the eye.

Gimli: Mithril! You are full of surprises Master Baggins. 


Gandalf: To the bridge of Khazad-dûm! 

Boromir: What is this new devilry? 
Gandalf: A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! Quickly!

Aragorn: Gandalf.
Gandalf: Lead them on Aragorn. The bridge is near.  Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.

Legolas: Gandalf.

Boromir: Merry! Pippin! Hoo-aah!


Aragorn: Sam. 

Gimli: Nobody tosses a Dwarf. 

Gimli: Not the beard!

Aragorn: Stay there. Hold on. Hang on! Lean forward!
Legolas: Come on!

Gandalf: Over the bridge! Fly!

Gandalf: You cannot pass! 
Frodo: Gandalf! 

Gandalf: I am the servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you! flame of Udûn!

Gandalf: Go back to the Shadow!

Gandalf: YOU…SHALL NOT…PASS!! 

Boromir: No, Frodo! 
Frodo: Gandaaalf!!
Gandalf: Fly you fools! 

 
Frodo: Nooooooo!!!

Boromir: Aragorn! 
Frodo: Nooooooo!!!
(Aragorn is shocked. He stares at the bridge in disbelief, unable to move for a few moments. But then orc arrows start whistling by once again. Dodging, he turns and follows the others up the stairs and out in the light.
The Fellowship comes running out of the East Gate of Moria. Everyone is distraught. Sam sits on the ground, bows his head onto his hands and begins to weep. Merry consoles Pippin, who lies on the ground crying. Boromir tries to restrain Gimli as the dwarf vents out his rage and sorrow. Legolas wears a look of shock and disbelief.
Aragorn stands on a distance from the others, cleaning his sword and re-sheathing it. Then he turns to the others)
Aragorn: Legolas, get them up.
Boromir: Give them a moment for pity’s sake. 
Aragorn: By nightfall these hills will be swarming with orcs! We must reach the Woods of Lothlórien. Come Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up. 

Aragorn: On your feet, Sam.  Frodo? Frodo!

Gimli: Stay close young hobbits! They say there’s a great sorceress lives in these woods, an Elf-witch of terrible power. All who look upon her, fall under her spell… 
Galadriel’s Voice:  Frodo… 

 
Gimli: …and are never seen again. 
Galadriel’s Voice: Your coming to us… ..is as the footsteps of Doom. You bring great evil here Ring-bearer!
Sam: Mr. Frodo?


Gimli: Well, here’s one Dwarf she won’t ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!

Gimli: Oh.. 
Haldir: The Dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark. 
Gimli:  
Aragorn: Haldir o Lórien. Henion aníron, boe ammen i dulu lîn. Boe ammen veriad lîn. *Haldir of Lorien, we come here for help. We need your protection.*

Gimli: Aragorn, these woods are perilous! We should go back.
Haldir: You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back.  Come, she is waiting. 

Celeborn: Eight there are here yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. 

Galadriel: He has fallen into shadow.  The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all. 

Galadriel: Yet hope remains while the Company is true. 

Galadriel: Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight you will sleep in peace…  Welcome Frodo of the Shire. One who has seen the Eye!

A Olorin i yaresse *Olorin, who once was…* Mentaner i Numeherui…*sent by the Lords of the West…*
Legolas: A lament for Gandalf. 

Merry: What do they say about him?
Legolas: I have not the heart to tell you. For me the grief is still too near. 
Tirien i Romenori *to guard the lands of the East…*
Maiarion i Oiosaila… *wisest of all Maiar…*
Mana elye etevanne… *what drove you to leave…*
Norie i melanelye? *that which you loved?*

Aragorn: Take some rest. These borders are well protected. 
Boromir: I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me even now there is hope left. But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope.
Boromir: My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing. And now our…our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. 
Have you ever seen it Aragorn? White tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? 
Aragorn: I have seen the White City, long ago. 
Boromir: One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guards shall take up the call: The Lords of Gondor have returned!

Galadriel: Will you look into the mirror? 
Frodo: What will I see? 
Galadriel: Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things. 
 
Galadriel: Things that were, things that are and some things…  that have not yet come to pass.

Galadriel: I know what it is you saw, for it is also in my mind.  It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. It has already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one it will destroy them all. 
Frodo:  If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.

Galadriel: You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. 

Galadriel: In place of a DARK LORD, YOU WILL HAVE A QUEEN! NOT DARK BUT BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE AS THE DAWN! TREACHEROUS AS THE SEA! STRONGER THAN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH! ALL SHALL LOVE ME AND DESPAIR!

Galadriel: I pass the test! I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel. 
Frodo: I cannot do this alone. 

Galadriel: You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of power is to be alone. This task was appointed to you and if you do not find a way, no one will. 
Frodo: Then I know what I must do. It’s just… I’m afraid to do it. 

Galadriel: Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

Saruman: Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?  They were Elves once, taken by the Dark Powers. Tortured and mutilated.. A ruined and terrible form of life. Now…perfected.. my fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve?
Lurtz: Saruman!

Saruman:  Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man flesh!

Saruman: One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others!


Galadriel:  Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.

Galadriel: Namárië.

Galadriel:  May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.

Aragorn: Frodo, the Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin.


Aragorn: We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. We approach Mordor from the north.
Gimli: Oh, yes?! It’s just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil? An impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks! And after that, it gets even better!  Festering, stinking marshlands far as the eye can see!
Aragorn: That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength Master Dwarf.
Gimli: Recover my…?! Grrrrrr.

Legolas: We should leave now.
Aragorn: No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
Legolas: It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near… I can feel it!
Gimli: No dwarf need recover strength!  Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.


Merry: Where’s Frodo?
(Sam, who was half-dozing, rouses with a start. Aragorn looks over the camp. His gaze stops on Boromir’s shield, lying with the baggage and he understands that Boromir is also gone.
In the forest, Frodo wanders around. He stands by an immense stone head, lying with its side on the ground. Boromir, gathering wood, sees Frodo and approaches him)

Boromir: I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo, other paths that we might take.

Frodo: I know what you would say. And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
Boromir: Warning? Against what? We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have. Don’t you see that is madness?
Frodo: There is no other way!
Boromir: I ask only for the strength to defend my people!  If you would but lend me the Ring…
Frodo: No! 
Boromir: Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
Frodo: You are not yourself.
Boromir: What chance do you think you have? They will find you! They will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end! 

Boromir: You fool!

Boromir: It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It could’ve been mine!  It should be mine! Give it to me!


Boromir: Give it to me!
Frodo: No!
Boromir: Give me… Give me the Ring!
Frodo: Noo…ugh!

Boromir: I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you! And all the halflings!

Boromir: Frodo? Frodo?…what have I done?…please…Frodo!
Boromir:  Frodo, I’m sorry! 

Aragorn: Frodo?


Frodo: It has taken Boromir.

Aragorn: Where is the Ring?
Frodo: Stay away! 

Aragorn: Frodo! 

Aragorn: I swore to protect you!
Frodo: Can you protect me from yourself?!

Frodo: Would you destroy it?

The Ring: Aragorn…Aragorn…Elessar…

Aragorn: I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor.
Frodo: I know. Look after the others, especially Sam. He will not understand.

Aragorn: Go Frodo.  Run!

Sam: Mr.Frodo!!
 
Lurtz:  Find the Halfling! Find the Halfling! 

Aragorn: Elendil!!!


Legolas: Aragorn! Go! 

Merry: Frodo!
Pippin: Hide here quick! Come on!

Pippin:  What’s he doin’? 


Merry: He’s leavin’. 
Pippin: No! 

Merry: Pippin! 

Merry:  Run Frodo! Go!


Merry: Hey! Hey you! Over here! 

Pippin: Hey! 
Merry: Over here!
Pippin:  This way!

Pippin: It’s working! 
Merry: I know it’s working! Run!
(Merry and Pippin run across an old stone bridge. At its far end, they stop and see Uruk-hai running towards them from another direction. The Uruks are closing in, both in front and behind. An Uruk runs up to them, raising his axe. But Boromir comes charging in, knocks the Uruk back, and kills him with his sword. He throws a knife at another.
Back at the Seat of Seeing, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli continue to fight the Uruk-Hai. In one smooth move, Legolas stabs one Uruk with an arrow then shoots it out at another. Aragorn stabs one behind his back. 
Legolas shoots first 3 Uruks in a row, then one who has closed in on Aragorn. Three loud ox-horn blasts are heard)
Legolas: The Horn of Gondor! 


Aragorn: Boromir!
(They run down the hills of Amon Hen towards the sound, but Uruks are between them and Boromir. A visual sweep shows some running towards Boromir, down the stone steps; the others attack Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they struggle to follow.
Boromir sounds the horn of Gondor again)
Boromir:  Run! Run! 
(The Uruks attack Boromir. He kills two more. Lurtz walks slowly into view, lifts his bow, aims a big black arrow, and shoots it into Boromir’s left shoulder. He gasps for breath and the hobbits look at him in shock. Boromir drops to his knees, begins to breathe hard, and looks at the hobbits. Uruks come closer, but he gives a battle cry, rises, and swings his sword at one, who falls. Lurtz growls, lifts his bow, and shoots again. A black arrow flies into Boromir’s stomach. He drops to his knees again, gasping. But he swings his sword at another Uruk and gets back up. Lurtz shoots him one more time, in the chest. Boromir falls on his knees and stays there, swaying a little and blinking.
Merry and Pippin look at him in shock. With all the courage they can find, they take up their swords and attack the Uruk-Hai with a cry) 
Merry and Pippin: Shire!!!!
(They never have the chance to strike. The Uruk-Hai lift them up and carry them off. Merry and Pippin wave their arms frantically. The Uruk-Hai troop walks past Boromir. Boromir stares after the hobbits, helpless.
Lurtz, now left alone, stops ten feet from Boromir and takes aim with his bow again. Boromir swallows and stares back at him. Just as Lurtz is about to let go of the arrow, Aragorn crashes into him, and the arrow flies off harmlessly.
They start a fight. Aragorn loses his sword and is thrown to the ground. When he gets up, Lurtz throws his shield at Aragorn and pins him by the neck against a tree. Lurtz raises his sword and strikes, but Aragorn slips beneath the shield and dodges. Aragorn pulls out a knife and stabs Lurtz in the leg. Lurtz roars and knocks Aragorn to the ground, making him roll a few feet away. Lurtz then pulls the knife out of his leg and throws it at Aragorn, who has found his sword and uses it to bat the knife away. Aragorn closes in on Lurtz and in a flurry of swordplay, slices his arm off and then stabs him in the chest. Lurtz grabs Aragorns sword and pulls himself up onto it, closer to Aragorn, snarling. Aragorn grimaces, pulls his sword out of Lurtz, swings it wide, and hacks off the Uruk’s head. The rest of Lurtz’s body falls to the ground.
Aragorn pauses a moment, panting. He then notices Boromir. Boromir, pale and bloodied, is now lying on his back, his head close to a tree) 
Aragorn: No! 

Boromir: They took the little ones.
Aragorn: Be still.
Boromir: Frodo, where is Frodo? 
Aragorn: I let Frodo go. 
Boromir: Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him. 
Aragorn: The Ring is beyond our reach now. 
Boromir: Forgive me, I did not see it. I have failed you all.
Aragorn: No, Boromir, you fought bravely! You have kept your honor. 

Boromir: Leave it! It is over. The world of Men will fall, and all will come to darkness… And my city to ruin. 
Aragorn: I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall, nor our people fail!
Boromir: Our people? Our people. 

Boromir: I would have followed you my brother, my captain, my king!

Aragorn: Be at peace, son of Gondor. 
(He bends and kisses Boromir on the brow. Legolas and Gimli arrive at the scene. Legolas looks sadly at Aragorn and Boromir, seeing what is going on. Gimli bows his head and turns away. 
Aragorn stands up, looking into the forest with a tear running down his face.)


Sam: Frodo! 

Frodo:  I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. 

Gandalf:  So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.

Sam: Frodo, no! Frodo! Mr. Frodo! 

Frodo:  No Sam. 

Frodo: Go back Sam! I’m going to Mordor alone. 
Sam: Of course you are, and I’m coming with you! 
Frodo: You can’t swim! Sam!


Frodo: Sam!!!

Sam: I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise! “Don’t you leave him Samwise Gamgee.” And I don’t mean to! I don’t mean to.

Frodo: Oh Sam! 

Frodo: Come on. 


Legolas: Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

Legolas: You mean not to follow them. 
Aragorn: Frodo’s fate is no longer in our hands. 
Gimli: Then it has all been in vain! The Fellowship has failed. 

Aragorn: Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let’s hunt some orc! 

Gimli: Yes!! Haha!


Frodo: Mordor. I hope the others find a safer route. 
Sam: Strider will look after them. 
Frodo: I don’t suppose we’ll ever see them again. 
Sam: We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.

Frodo: Sam, I’m glad you’re with me.
