'''Elendil''' ([[Quenya]]; ''"The Elf-friend"''<ref>''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 156]] (to Robert Murray, S.J.)</ref>), also known as '''Elendil the Tall/the Fair''' or '''Voronda''' ([[Quenya|Q.]]; "The Faithful"), was a [[men|man]] of [[Númenor]] who led the [[Dúnedain|survivors]] of its [[Akallabêth|Downfall]] to the shores of [[Middle-earth]] where they founded two [[Realms in Exile]], [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south. Thus, Elendil became the first [[Kings of Arnor|king]] of [[Kings of Gondor|both]] Realms and also held the title of the first [[King of all the Dúnedain|High King of the Dúnedain]], which made him the supreme overlord of all exiled [[Númenóreans]] in the lands to the east of the [[Great Sea]]. Elendil was known as the greatest warrior of all the Dúnedain. He was killed alongside his friend [[High King of the Ñoldor|Elven-king]] [[Gil-galad]] by the [[Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]] at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], during the [[War of the Last Alliance]] in the late [[Second Age]].

== History ==
=== Life in Númenor ===

Elendil was born in 3119 of the [[Second Age]] in [[Númenor]], son of [[Amandil]], [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] and leader of [[the Faithful]] (those who remained loyal to the [[Valar]]), who maintained a strong friendship with the Elves and preserved the old ways against the practices of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] and Sauron. For this Sauron hated Amandil, and by extension Elendil, the most out of all the [[Númenóreans|Númenóreans.]]<ref name=":0" /> He was married to an unnamed Númenórean woman no doubt of the same upbringing and noble blood to which they had two sons: [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]. It is not known whether she followed him to Middle-earth after the [[Akallabêth|Fall of Númenor]].<ref name=":0">''[[The Silmarillion]], [[Akallabêth]]'' (The Downfall of Númenor)</ref>

When Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron were preparing their [[Great Armament|assault]] on [[Valinor]], Amandil told him to gather the Faithful in [[Rómenna]] and escape to Middle-earth. Elendil did as his father told him, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.<ref name=":0" /> With them, they took the ''[[palantir]]i'', the "Seeing Stones" that were given to the Lords of Andúnie by the elves of [[Tol Eressëa]], and a seedling of [[Nimloth]], the [[White Tree]] of Númenor.

When the Downfall came, the great wave that devoured Númenor was coming towards Rómenna when a great storm came out of the West, snapping the sails of his ships and tossing them around in giant waves, and carried him all the way to Middle-earth.<ref name=":0" /> With the Downfall, Elendil and his children became the sole surviving descendants of the [[House of Elros]].

=== Founder of Arnor and Gondor ===

Elendil's four ships were separated from those of his sons and arrived in [[Eriador]]. As he landed Elendil proclaimed in [[Quenya]]: ''Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta'' - "Out of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world." His heir and 89<sup>th</sup>-great-grandson [[Aragorn]] spoke these traditional words again when he took up the crown of [[Gondor]] at the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]].

Elendil was welcomed to Eriador by the Elven-king [[Gil-galad]] and in [[SA 3320]] he founded the Kingdom of Arnor, building the city of [[Annúminas]] as his capital. The five ships carrying Elendil's sons landed further south, where Anárion founded the city of [[Minas Anor]] in [[Anórien]], and his son [[Isildur]] founded [[Minas Ithil]] in [[Ithilien]]. They ruled the new realm of Gondor jointly as its Kings from their capital city of [[Osgiliath]]. Across the realms towers were built for the ''Palantíri'', with which the two kingdoms kept contact.<ref name="SilmRings">''The Silmarillion, [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref>

=== Last Alliance of Elves and Men ===

[[File:Elendil_during_the_Last_Alliance.jpg|thumb|240px|Elendil with his men during the Last Alliance, as seen in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]

In time Sauron returned to Middle-earth, establishing a stronghold in [[Mordor]], next to [[Gondor]]. In [[SA 3429]], he attacked seizing [[Minas Ithil]]. Isildur fled north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of the defence of Gondor. In [[SA 3434]], Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven [[High King of the Ñoldor|High King]] Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]].

After [[Battle of Dagorlad|defeating]] Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the armies of Men and Elves settled into a siege of the main tower of Sauron: [[Siege of Barad-dûr|Barad-dûr]]. During this siege Anárion was killed.

[[File:Elendil_Death.png|thumb|260px|Elendil's dying body is held by his son, Isildur.]]

After seven years of siege, in [[SA 3441]] Sauron came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the process, and Elendil's [[Narsil|sword]] broke when he fell.<ref name="Appendix">''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Second Age"</ref>

Isildur used his father's broken sword to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a hidden [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb]] for his father on the summit of the hill of [[Amon Anwar]]<ref name="SilmRings" /><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter II: "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"</ref>, the midpoint of Gondor. Later, with the creation of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] [[Cirion]] had Elendil's casket moved to [[Rath Dínen]] in [[Minas Tirith]].

=== Legacy ===

Leading the remnant of [[The Faithful]] [[Númenóreans]] to [[Middle-earth]], Elendil established strong regimes there and created the [[Last Alliance|great alliance]] that put an end to [[Sauron]]'s power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and spirited leadership survived in the [[Dúnedain]] of the [[Arnor|North]] and [[Gondor|South]] of Middle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic [[Men]] that would help bring a final end to Sauron in the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]],'' The Second Age, "The Realms in Exile"</ref><ref>''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]],'' The Second Age, "The Last Alliance"</ref>

[[Aragorn]]'s battle-cry in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was '''''Elendil!'''.''

==== The Oath of Elendil ====

Lyrics, in [[Quenya]]:<br />''Et Eärello<br />Endorenna utúlien<br />Sinome Maruvan<br />ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta''

Translation:<br />''Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.<br />In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'"''

This oath was sung an age later by [[Aragorn II Elessar]], during his coronation at the end of the War of the Ring.

== Portrayal in Adaptations ==
=== Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy ===
Elendil makes brief appearance in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]] ''at the Battle of the Last Alliance'','' and was played by [[Peter McKenzie|Peter McKenzie.]] Unlike in the books, Elendil is killed by a blow from Sauron attempting to do battle, instead of in a duel with him alongside Gil-galad. Instead [[Isildur]] alone deals the fatal blow to the still-living Sauron by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of [[Narsil]], and with them the One Ring. Another deviation is Elendil's height; he is shown to be near the same height as most of his troops.[[File:Elendil - LOTRO.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Elendil in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]

=== The Lord of the Rings Online===
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Elendil appears in several flashbacks depicting the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than to the films: he and [[Gil-galad]] seen battling and defeating [[Sauron]] at the cost of their lives, with Elendil dealing the killing blow.

== Etymology ==

''Elendil'' meant either "Elf-friend" or "Star-lover" in [[Quenya]].

{{House of Elros}}
