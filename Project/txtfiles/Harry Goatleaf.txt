'''Harry Goatleaf''' was the gatekeeper of [[Bree]]'s western gate during the time of the [[War of the Ring]].

== History ==
Harry Goatleaf encountered [[Frodo]], [[Merry]], [[Pippin]] and [[Sam]] when they entered Bree in the year [[TA 3018]]. The gate which he guarded was located within a great hedge surrounding the township of Bree.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. IX: "[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]"</ref>

Harry was in the Common Room of the [[Prancing Pony]] and witnessed Frodo's disappearance when the [[The One Ring|Ring]] slipped onto his finger after his performance of a folk [[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late|song]]. Harry left the inn following the departure of [[Bill Ferny]] and a [[Squint-eyed Southerner]]. [[Aragorn]] later told Frodo that he suspected that the [[Black Riders]] might use Bill Ferny and Harry Goatleaf as well as others for evil work. Later that night the inn was attacked and the [[hobbits]]' empty room was ransacked.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']], Book One, Ch. X: "[[Strider (chapter)|Strider]]"</ref>

Early in the New Year of [[TA 3019]], fighting broke out between the Southerners and the [[Men of Bree|Bree-folk]]. Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny sided with a group of brigands from the south, and participated in trouble that caused the death of five Men of Bree. He left Bree with the group, presumably to join [[Saruman|Sharkey]]'s Men in the [[Shire]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Return of the King|''The Return of the King'']], Book Six, Ch. VII: "[[Homeward Bound]]"</ref>
