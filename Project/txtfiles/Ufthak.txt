'''Ufthak''' was a [[Mordor]] [[Orc]] serving in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

== Biography ==

At some time while with a band of fellow Orcs including [[Shagrat]], Ufthak got lost in the tunnels of [[Torech Ungol]] and was caught by [[Shelob]], poisoned and hung up in a corner. When others found him, he was still alive and awake, but they did nothing to help him, out of fear of what would happen if they interfered with her work.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers (novel)|The Two Towers]],'' Book Four, Ch. X: "[[The Choices of Master Samwise]]"</ref>
