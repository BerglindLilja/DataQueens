'''Sauron''' ([[Quenya|Q.]]: [[IPA charts|IPA]] {{IPA|[ˈsaʊron]}} or [[Vanyarin|{{IPA|[ˈθaʊron]}}]]), the eponymous '''Lord of the Rings''', originally called '''Mairon''', was a fallen [[Maiar|Maia]], creator of the [[One Ring]], a gifted student of [[Valar|Vala]] [[Aulë|Aulë the Smith]] and lieutenant of [[Melkor]] (Morgoth). After his master's [[War of Wrath|defeat by the Valar]], Sauron became the second [[Dark Lord]] and sought to conquer [[Middle-earth]] by creating the [[Rings of Power]].

At the end of the [[Second Age]], he was defeated in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] united under kings [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]]. In the final battle, [[Isildur]] managed to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger, dismantling the Dark Lord's corporeal form and power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding his strength, Sauron returned to power late in the [[Third Age]], but was permanently crippled in the [[War of the Ring]] after destruction of the One Ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] by a [[hobbit]] named [[Frodo Baggins]].

Sauron was also called '''Gorthaur the Cruel''' by the [[Sindar|Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] in the [[First Age]].

== History ==

=== Years of the Lamps ===
Long before the First Age, Sauron's name was originally Mairon. He was the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aulë the Smith, and learned much from Aulë in the ways of smithying and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman, and "mighty in the lore of" Aulë's people.<ref>''The Silmarillion, [[Valaquenta]]'', "Of the ''Enemies''"</ref> He was among the most powerful Maiar.

During this time, Mairon was as [[Eru Ilúvatar|Eru]] had created him: good and uncorrupted. His greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection--his dislike of anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of his downfall, because Mairon saw in the [[Dark Lord]] [[Melkor|Morgoth]] the will and power that would help him achieve his own goals and desires faster than if he pursued them alone. However, while Morgoth wanted to either control or destroy Middle-earth itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures. Though he allied himself with Morgoth, in truth, Sauron did not seek to serve, only to command (which would prove useful in understanding the mind of [[Saruman]]). In testimony to his cunning, Sauron benefited from his former services: presenting himself as a minister of the Valar to the Elves, and later as Morgoth's prophet to the [[Númenóreans]] (when other means would not do). 

After allying himself with Morgoth, Mairon maintained his appearance of being faithful to the Valar, but secretly fed Morgoth information about their dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in Middle-earth that Mairon left [[Valinor]] and openly declared his allegiance, thence becoming a recognized foe of the Valar and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.

Before Melkor's captivity, Sauron commanded the fortress of [[Angband]] and served as Melkor's lieutenant. At the beginning of the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Valar forces leveled Angband with little difficulty, though it is not know for certain if Sauron was present when the fortress was attacked. When [[Utumno]] was sacked and Melkor captured, Sauron was nowhere to be found, and in their haste to both capture Melkor and remove him from Middle-earth, the Valar paid little heed to Melkor's most terrible servants.<ref>''The Silmarillion'','' Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter III: "[[Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor]]"</ref>

The [[Sindar]] Elves in Beleriand called him ''Gorthaur'', meaning "dread abomination"<ref name="index">''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Index of Names</ref>,while others of the [[Eldar]] named him ''Sauron'', meaning "the abhorred" or "the abominable" (a mockery of his original name).

=== First Age ===
In the First Age, the [[Ñoldor]] [[Elves]] left the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the [[Undying Lands|Utter West]] (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to wage war on Morgoth, who had stolen the [[Silmarils|Silmarils of Fëanor]], enchanted gems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In that war, Sauron was counted as the "greatest of [Morgoth's] servants that have names". His only equal in rank was [[Gothmog (Balrog)|Gothmog]], the High Captain of Angband, and was soon feared as a lord of phantoms and dreadful beasts - a shape-shifter, sorcerer, and cunning servant of his master.

When Melkor left Angband much later to corrupt the newly awakened [[Men|Atani]] (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves.<ref>''The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XVII: "[[Of the Coming of Men into the West]]"</ref> He conquered the Elvish isle of [[Tol Sirion]], so that it became known as ''Tol-in-Gaurhoth'', the Isle of Werewolves.<ref>''The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XVIII: "[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]"</ref> He was the Lord of the [[Werewolves]] there, and [[Draugluin]] was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the vampire [[Thuringwethil]].

After the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Sauron's hunters brought [[Gorlim]] and interrogated him about [[Barahir]]'s (father of [[Beren]]) location. Gorlim refused to tell them anything, even under torture, until Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked for his wife [[Eilinel]], whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and Gorlim yielded the information. However, Sauron revealed that Eilinel was dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. During the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Beren]] and [[Finrod]] King of [[Nargothrond]] were captured by Sauron, who defeated Finrod in a duel with songs of power. He stripped them of their Orc disguises and cast them into the dark pits where werewolves devoured their companions. When a werewolf came to attack Beren, Finrod wrestled with and killed it, but died soon after of his injuries.

Soon afterward, [[Lúthien]] and [[Huan]] the wolfhound arrived at the bridge of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent wolves to capture Lúthien, but all were slain by Huan. One of them was Draugluin, but he fled and told his master that Huan was there. Therefore, Sauron took the form of a werewolf and leaped to attack Lúthien, only to be intercepted and subdued by Huan. He yielded the tower to Lúthien and escaped in the form of a "vampire".<ref name="ofberen">''The Silmarillion'','' [[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Chapter XIX: "[[Of Beren and Lúthien]]"</ref>

After his defeat by Lúthien, Sauron played little part in the events of the First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's scorn or wrath). After his former master was [[War of Wrath|defeated]] and taken to Valinor in chains, Sauron seemed to repent and plead [[Eönwë]] and the victorious [[Host of Valinor|Host of the West]] for mercy, although he may have only been daunted by their triumph. At the same time, Sauron was unwilling to return to the Utter West for judgment out of pride, and instead fled and hid somewhere in Middle-earth.<ref>''The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter XXIV: "[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]"</ref>

=== Second Age ===
==== Forging of the One Ring ====
{{Blockquote|This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it – but he must ''not'' get it.|[[Gandalf]], ''The Lord of the Rings'', "The Shadow of the Past" pg.48(Bottom)}}
[[File:Mordor Orc army flashback.jpg|thumb|Sauron raised massive armies for his conquest|alt=|336x336px]]
After remaining hidden and dormant for five hundred years, Sauron began revealing himself once more, and by [[SA 1000]] he gathered his power and established himself in the land of [[Mordor]] in eastern Middle-earth and began building the dreaded [[Barad-dûr]] near [[Mount Doom]]. Sauron soon began raising massive armies of [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and other creatures from the days of Morgoth, as well as corrupting the hearts of [[Men]], chiefly the [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]] with delusions of power and wealth. It may be noted that at first he was not wholly evil, rather intending to rebuild Middle-Earth from the destruction caused at the battle at the end of the First Age, but slowly he was corrupted by lure of power and the 'bonds' Melkor placed upon him, causing him to revert to his old devices. 

Although Sauron knew that men were easier to sway, he sought to bring the Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful. By about [[SA 1500]], Sauron put on a fair visage and called himself Annatar, the "Lord of Gifts". He befriended the Elf smiths of [[Eregion]], including [[Celebrimbor]] (greatest of craftsmen, as he was descended from Fëanor), and counseled them in arts and magic. Not all the Elves trusted him, particularly Lady [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Gil-galad]], [[High King of the Ñoldor]].

To the Elves who listened, Sauron gave knowledge and encouragement in forging the [[Rings of Power]], while he forged the [[One Ring]] in secret, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron wrote in [[Tengwar]] the Black Speech inscription, ''Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.'' This translates as: ''One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.''

[[File:One_Ring_To_Rule_Them_All.png|thumb|left|300px|The One Ring worn by Sauron]]

However, as soon as Sauron put on the Ring the Elves sensed his treachery, and removed their rings and hid them. Enraged, Sauron came against them in [[War of the Elves and Sauron|open war]] and demanded that all Rings of Power be given to him. The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the Rings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either captured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the [[Dwarves]] he had given [[Seven Rings|Seven]], but to Men he had given [[Nine Rings|Nine]], knowing that they would be the easiest to corrupt. The Dwarf Lords who received the Rings proved to be very resistant to their power, and neither "faded" nor became enslaved to Sauron's will. The Rings, however, created in them an insatiable lust for gold, which ultimately caused a great deal of grief for the Dwarves.

<nowiki> </nowiki>As Sauron predicted, the nine Men were all corrupted by their Rings and became the [[Nazgûl]], Sauron's deadliest and cruelest servants. Had the Elves not recognized Sauron's treachery and forsaken the power of their rings, the results would have been catastrophic. It seems that most of the native Men of Middle-earth succumbed to the power of the Ring once the Nazgûl were created, and if the Elves been captured in this fashion, they would have become the slaves of Sauron. Thus Celebrimbor's resistance was of immense importance in the history of Middle-earth.

In this era, during which he marshaled and commanded great armies, Sauron became known as the [[Dark Lord]] of [[Mordor]], and his [[fortress]] of [[Barad-dûr]] was completed in [[SA 1600]]. He was very powerful even without controlling the Elves, and conquered nearly all of Middle-earth during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. However, the armies of the king of [[Númenor]], [[Tar-Minastir]], were able to defeat him during the [[Battle of the Gwathló]] in [[SA 1700]]. Defeated but not wholly vanquished, Sauron retreated back to Mordor and began re-building his strength over the many centuries.

Towards the end of the Second Age, Sauron was once again powerful enough to raise again large armies to attempt to rule Middle-earth. By this time, he assumed the titles of "Lord of the Earth" and "[[King of Men]]", which offended the [[Númenóreans]]; the powerful Men descended from those who had fought against Melkor in the War of Wrath. Some were the descendants, through [[Elros]], of Beren and Lúthien.

==== Life in Númenor ====
[[File:Nemanja Bubalo - Sauron Priest of Númenor.jpg|left|thumb|280x280px|Depiction of Sauron as a priest of [[Melkor]] in [[Númenor]] ]]
These Men lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth and Valinor. The Númenóreans, who were then proud, came to Middle-earth with astounding force of arms. King [[Ar-Pharazôn]], who desired no less than the kingship of Middle-earth, marched his troops all the way to Mordor without a single battle, and demanded that Sauron abase himself before the King. Sauron could see clearly that even the most powerful of his servants could not stand against the Númenóreans, and so came from Barad-dûr without any offer of battle. He assumed a fair form and flattered Ar-Pharazôn, but the King demanded that Sauron come back to Númenor as a hostage. Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but was secretly delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to destroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in Númenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and nearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of [[death]], he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, saying that Morgoth had the power to save them from mortality. As his power and influence reached its peak, he raised a great [[Temple]] in which he performed human sacrifices to Morgoth. Finally, he convinced Ar-Pharazôn to rebel against the Valar and [[Great Armament|attack]] Valinor itself and claim it for himself.

But here, Sauron's cunning overreached itself, for Eru then directly intervened—Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed and the army that reached [[Aman]] was buried under mountains of falling rock and imprisoned in the [[Caves of the Forgotten]]. The world was [[Change of the World|bent]], so that thereafter, only Elven-Ships could sail into the Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not diminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly rebuilt a new body and his strength. From this point on, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape, and ruled now through terror and force. A few faithful Númenóreans led by Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded two [[Realms in Exile]], [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor|Gondor,]] in Middle-earth.

==== Loss of the Ring ====
[[File:Sauron vanquished.webp|thumb|250.4x250.4px|alt=|Sauron defeated, after the One Ring was cut from his hand]]
After learning that [[Elendil]], whom he had especially hated, had survived and was ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron, after a while, made war on them. He struck too soon, however, and had not restored most of his strength, whereas the Elven-king, [[Gil-galad]] had increased his power on Middle-earth in his absence. Therefore, when Gil-Galad allied with Elendil to create the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and together attacked Sauron. They defeated his armies at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], and laid [[Siege of Barad-dûr|siege to]] Barad-dûr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled with both Elendil and Gil-galad, slaying them both single-handedly; however, he himself was overthrown in the process. Then [[Isildur]], son of Elendil, took up his father's broken sword, [[Narsil]], and used it to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger. While Sauron's physical body was destroyed, his spirit endured and fled. But his campaign to defeat the free peoples had seemingly failed, with his greatest weapon having been taken from him.

But while Isildur had taken the Ring, he could not bring himself to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged, but kept it for himself. He was eventually betrayed by it a few years later, and [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|slain]] by Orcs at the [[Gladden Fields]]. The Ring fell into the Gladden river, and was lost for centuries.

=== Third Age ===

Despite his defeat, Sauron was not vanquished permanently. Though greatly weakened, and in non-corporeal form, he still existed, due to pouring most of his native power, strength, and will into the One Ring. Thus, as long as it existed, he could never be truly defeated, and during the first millenium of the [[Third Age]], he lay in hiding, slowly recovering his strength until he was once again able to take physical form.

==== The Necromancer of Dol Guldur ====
[[File:The Necromancer in Dol Guldur.webp|thumb|Sauron's appearance as "the Necromancer"|alt=|264x264px]]
In the year [[TA 1000]], Sauron at last began to rise again, occupying the stronghold of [[Dol Guldur]], the Hill of Sorcery, in southern [[Mirkwood]] in [[TA 1050]]. There, he was disguised as a dark sorcerer known as "the Necromancer", and the Elves did not realize at first that he was actually Sauron returned.

Around this time, the Valar sent the five [[Wizards]], or ''Istari'', including [[Gandalf]] the Grey, who later became Gandalf the White, to oppose Sauron and rally the free peoples of Middle-earth against him.

While Sauron continued to gather his strength, the [[Nazgûl]] reappeared in the year [[TA 1300]], and began steadily assaulting the Númenórean kingdoms in exile, ultimately destroying the North Kingdom of Arnor and gravely weakening the South Kingdom of Gondor.

Suspecting that Sauron had returned and was guiding the Nazgûl, the wizard Gandalf infiltrated Dol Guldur in [[TA 2063]] to confirm his theory, but Sauron fled into the east to conceal his identity. This marked the beginning of the [[Watchful Peace]], which ended with Sauron's return to Dol Guldur in [[TA 2460]]. During the same year, the One Ring was finally discovered by the [[Stoor]] [[Gollum|Sméagol]] and his friend [[Déagol]]. Sméagol murdered Déagol and took the Ring for himself. Sméagol was eventually so changed by the Ring's corruption he was given the name Gollum and forced to hide in the Misty Mountains.
Gandalf the Grey made a second intrusion into Dol Guldur in [[TA 2850]], and finally discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. Eventually, the [[White Council]] put forth their might and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur permanently in [[TA 2941]]. Without the Ring in his possession and facing the combined power of the three Elven rings and the skill of [[Saruman]], Sauron could draw on only the smallest fraction of his strength, so that his enemies were able to drive him from Dol Guldur with relative ease. However, the Dark Lord, having had ample time to prepare, abandoned Dol Guldur willingly, and returned secretly to [[Mordor]], where he openly declared himself in [[TA 2951]], and began preparations for his final war to dominate Middle-earth.[[File:Ringwraiths-733735.jpg|thumb|260px|The Ringwraiths in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']]

==== War of the Ring ====
Sauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with and enslaved Men from the east and south. He gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazgûl (''Ulairi'' in Quenya), or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings designed for mortal men. He adopted the symbol of a [[Eye of Sauron|lidless eye]], and as he exerted his will over Middle-earth, the Eye of Sauron became a symbol of power and fear.

After Gollum was captured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic ring, and, from him, he heard the words ''Shire'' and ''Baggins''. He deduced that Gollum's ring was the One Ring, and sent his servants, the dreaded Nazgûl, to find ''Shire'' and search for ''Baggins,'' so that the One Ring might be found and returned to him.

Meanwhile, Sauron lured Saruman the White, one of the Istari, into his service, and used him to try to destroy [[Rohan]], one of the major obstacles to Sauron's conquest of [[Gondor]] and the remaining Elves. Saruman failed however, and Sauron lost one of his most powerful vassals as well as Saruman's large [[Uruk-hai]] army. 

[[File:SauronAragorn.png|thumb|320px|Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron through the Palantír]]

Shortly after Saruman's defeat, [[Peregrin Took]] looked into the [[Palantíri|palantír]] that the wizard had possessed and accidentally communicated with Sauron, who believed that his treacherous servant had captured either the [[Halfling]]s bearing the Ring, or some who might know of it. But shortly thereafter [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]] took the palantír and revealed himself to Sauron, and seeing Aragorn, the Dark Lord concluded that Saruman had fallen and that the heir of Isildur possessed the One Ring. Fearing that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up his plans and attacked the city of [[Minas Tirith]] in Gondor sooner than he had planned, seeking to raze the city and crush the last human resistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it, and to prevent the Men of the West uniting under one king.

Due to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Arnor]], Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing more than enough military strength to destroy Minas Tirith and easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to grow in Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of strife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could move out and take the Ring for himself.

==== Downfall ====

Despite their successful repulse of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in Mordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the city. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, [[Frodo Baggins]] stood almost no chance of reaching Mount Doom undetected. In light of the situation, Aragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all the forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their commander until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those present that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not hope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options available. They could station their remaining force, considerably greater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements from Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure Sauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the [[Black Gate]] and attempt to challenge Sauron directly. This force, as Gandalf suggested, would only need to be great enough to offer battle, and the rest of their forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option, though suicidal for those involved, would serve to distract Sauron from gazing into his own land, through which the Ring Bearer would be traveling. Furthermore, Gandalf theorized that, once Sauron learned that a force too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the Black Gate to directly assault Mordor, he would likely believe that the leader of the attacking force would have the One Ring in their possession. Sauron would assume that the Ring itself would influence its wielder, who, in his pride and over-confidence in his newfound power, might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's might with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter IX: "The Last Debate"</ref>

Their plot worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and marched them towards [[Udûn (Mordor)|Udûn]] to crush the Men of the West and regain his prize. This action left the Plains of [[Gorgoroth]] largely unguarded, allowing Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] to reach Mount Doom with far less difficulty than otherwise. However, once Frodo reached the [[Cracks of Doom]], he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring, and put it on. Immediately, Sauron became aware of the halfling, and turning his gaze towards the mountain. He frantically sent the Ringwraiths to retrieve the Ring, but was too late, as Gollum, after taking the Ring from Frodo, slipped and fell to his death into the Cracks of Doom. The Ring was unmade. The earth shook as a great shock wave rippled across Mordor, and the foundations of Barad-dûr were finally destroyed, causing the great fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. The cone of Mount Doom burst apart in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight remaining Nazgul.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter III: "Mount Doom"</ref>

[[File:Untitledhj.png|thumb|280px|Barad-dûr's downfall]]

With his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his armies were destroyed or scattered, bereft of the driving will behind their conquest. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron was permanently robbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that hovered above Mordor as a "huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent," only to be blown away by a great wind.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' Book Six, Chapter IV: "The Field of Cormallen"</ref>

With the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being and his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's power was forever crippled, and the threat of his dominion was forever removed.

{{Blockquote|"If it [the Ring] is destroyed, then he will fall, and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And so a great evil of this world will be removed."|''[[The Return of the King (novel)|The Return of the King]],'' "The Last Debate"}}

== Etymology ==

'''''Sauron''''' is the [[Quenya]] term for "the Abhorred".<ref name="index" /> In [[Sindarin]], it is translated as '''''Gorthaur''''' from ''gor'' ("horror, dread") and ''thaur'' ("abominable, abhorrent").<ref>''The Silmarillion'', Appendix: Elements in Quenya and Sindarin names</ref>

=== Other names ===

His original name was said to be '''Mairon''' ("the Admirable", from ''maira'' meaning "admirable, excellent"), a name he used while in Númenor, adding the title "Tar" for "Tar-Mairon" ("King Excellent").<ref>''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'', Words, Phrases and Passages in Various Tongues in ''The Lord of the Rings'' by J.R.R. Tolkien</ref> The [[Númenóreans]] themselves gave him a name '''Zigúr''' meaning ''"Sorcerer"'' on the [[Adûnaic]].

=== Earlier names ===

'''Thû''' was Tolkien's earliest name for Sauron, in the original [[Lay of Leithian]]. Thu is reintroduced as an alternate name for Sauron in Beren and Luthien (2017).

'''Tevildo''', before that, was the name of the forerunner character to Sauron, a "Prince of Cats" who is a villain told of in the stories of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In [[Beren and Lúthien|''Beren and Lúthien'']] (2017), Tevildo is presented as a separate character from Thu/Sauron, and one of Morgoth's other minions.

== Character ==
Despite being the title character of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Sauron is notable for never directly appearing during the events of the trilogy. Nowhere is any detailed description given of what he looks like, other than in vague terms.

In the time of ''The Silmarillion'', however, Sauron was a shape changer, taking in one instance the forms of a serpent, a vampire, and a great wolf. After Morgoth's fall, Sauron appeared in fair form as "Annatar", the Lord of Gifts, and maintained this appearance until the fall of Númenor, in which he was unable to ever take a fair form ever again. ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' includes a passage vaguely describing how the [[Númenóreans]] saw him: "Upon that ship which was cast highest and stood dry upon a hill there was a man, but greater than any even of the race of Númenor in stature...And it seemed to men that Sauron was great; though they feared the light of his eyes. To many he appeared fair, to others terrible; but to some evil."<ref>''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 5: ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part One: "The Fall of Númenor and the Lost Road"</ref><br clear="left" />A few clues are given as to Sauron's appearance as the Dark Lord, after he lost his ability to take a fair form: Tolkien described Sauron in one of his letters as having the form of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic, and as an image of malice and hatred made visible. He apparently gave off great heat, so much so that Gil-galad was burned to death by his mere touch, and Isildur described Sauron's hand as black, yet burning like fire, suggesting that his entire body was blackened from fire and heat.

Gollum, having apparently once seen Sauron directly, described him as having only four fingers on his black hand, suggesting that Sauron was unable to regenerate the finger from which Isildur took the One Ring, similar to how the wounds Morgoth took from [[Fingolfin]] never healed.

In addition to his physical appearance, Sauron also apparently had an aura of incredible malevolence. A passage in ''The Silmarillion'' describes him as having a "dreadful presence," and daunting eyes.<ref name="ofberen" />

Regarding Sauron's personality, Tolkien said in his letters:

{{Blockquote|In my story Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible. He had gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of the Earth. But he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) spirit. Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants, by a triple treachery: 1. Because of his admiration of Strength he had become a follower of Morgoth and fell with him down into the depths of evil, becoming his chief agent in Middle-earth. 2. when Morgoth was defeated by the Valar finally he forsook his allegiance; but out of fear only; he did not present himself to the Valar or sue for pardon, and remained in Middle-earth. 3. When he found how greatly his knowledge was admired by all other rational creatures and how easy it was to influence them, his pride became boundless.|J.R.R. Tolkien<ref>''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', 183 Notes on W. H. Auden's review of ''The Return of the King''</ref>}}
Philosopher [[Peter J. Kreeft]] proposes that Sauron is in fact the main character of ''The Lord of the Rings'', inasmuch as he has the largest significance to the work of good and evil in the story, given his shared essence with the Ring; and given the title's referral to him.

== Weapons and powers ==

Sauron was among the mightiest of the Maiar. Originally of Aulë's people, he acquired great "scientific" knowledge of the world's substances and how to use them. He would retain this knowledge throughout his reign as the Dark Lord in Middle-earth, using it to forge the One Ring and construct his fortress of Barad-dûr. Sauron also seemed primarily linked to the use of fire, and as Morgoth's chief lieutenant, his ability to tap into the fires in the Earth was of great value.
[[File:2014-10-10 00015.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|Sauron's fair disguise as "Annatar"]]
Among Sauron's chief powers were deception and disguise: In the First Age Sauron took on many forms. During his battle against Luthien and Huan in ''The Silmarillion, ''he took on no less than four separate shapes: his "normal" shape, (some kind of terrible dark sorcerer), a great wolf, a serpent, and finally a vampire "dripping blood from his throat upon the trees" ("[[Of Beren and Lúthien]]," ''The Silmarillion''). At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form to appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon. In the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under the alias "Annatar" to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of Power. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must have gone beyond simply taking on a fair form, since Sauron was literally instructing the Elves to make artifacts that, while capable of great good, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued with power to arrest the natural order of the world, yet the Elves were unaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only narrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive the Númenóreans and steer them directly to their own destruction under promises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron's manipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.

[[File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Sauron_by_Alexander_Liptak.png|thumb|left|Depiction of Mordor's coat-of-arms, with the Eye of Sauron]]

An interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his symbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most wary, he represented himself as an all-seeing eye that could pierce all disguises. 

The extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron's power are largely left to the imagination. Like Morgoth, he was capable of altering the physical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.

== Symbol ==

The symbol of Sauron was the ''Eye of Sauron'', particularly after he arose in [[Mirkwood]] at Dol Guldur. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' it is called also the ''Great Eye,'' the ''Eye of Barad-dûr,'' the ''Red Eye,'' the ''Lidless Eye,'' and the ''Evil Eye.''

== Earlier versions of the legendarium ==

Since the earliest versions of the ''Silmarillion'' legendarium (as detailed in [[the History of Middle-earth|''The History of Middle-earth'']]), Sauron underwent many changes. The prototype of his character was '''[[Tevildo]]''', "Prince of Cats", who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] told in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. Tevildo was soon transformed into '''[[Thû]]''', the Necromancer, whose name would be emended to '''Gorthû''', '''Sûr''', and finally to '''Sauron'''. ''Gorthû'' in the form '''Gorthaur''' remained in ''The Silmarillion''. In Númenor, he was once known (according to ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' and associated writings) as '''''Zigûr'''''.

Prior to the publication of ''The Silmarillion'', Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to J.R.R. Tolkien's notes, so that early editions of the ''Guide to Middle-earth'' described Sauron as "probably of the Eldar elves".

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy ===
{{Blockquote|You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.|Saruman to Gandalf in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.}}
[[File:Eye of Sauron - TTT.jpg|thumb|Sauron's primary appearance throughout the film trilogy is as a flaming eye]]
Sauron's primary appearance in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Lord of the Rings film trilogy|trilogy]] is as the [[Eye of Sauron]], a titanic, flaming eye atop [[Barad-dûr]]; many characters refer to it as "the Eye" or "the Great Eye." His prior physical form was as a nine-foot-tall being clad in  black armor, seen only in flashbacks to the [[War of the Last Alliance]] throughout the trilogy, and very briefly in the center of the Eye in an extended scene with Aragorn and the ''[[palantír]]'' in ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]''. When Sauron speaks, it is telepathically through the One Ring or the ''Palantír''; when he is voiced by [[Alan Howard]]. [[Sala Baker]] portrays his physical form.

"''You cannot hide. I see you. There is no life in the [[void]], only death.''"

- Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''
[[File:Sauron first appearance - FOTR.jpg|thumb|Sauron is portrayed as an armoured figure in the flashbacks]]
As in the books, Sauron is the primary antagonist throughout the films. He is depicted as an almost god-like entity whose mere presence, even when mediated by a medium like the ''Palantír'', causes immense pain and injury. Most of his bidding is achieved through his various servants such as the ''Nazgûl'' and [[Saruman]], who calls him "the Lord of the Earth." Sauron is most extensively depicted in the prologue to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', shown forging the One Ring and leading his armies at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. According to Tolkien's description, he is shown to be towering over men and yet not gigantic. He also wears black armor and a helmet similar to [[Morgoth]]'s in ''The Silmarillion'', and wields a giant mace (perhaps based on [[Grond]]) capable of killing scores of men in one hit.

Sauron was originally intended to appear in physical form at the climax of ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'', appearing at the [[Battle of the Morannon]] to fight Aragorn. However, this was ultimately scrapped from the film due to the fact it was not in the book and the developers believed it would take the main focus away from Sam and Frodo. Furthermore, Jackson believed it would take away from Aragorn's act of sacrifice.

The Eye of Sauron's feline appearance is a reference to the character of "Tevildo" in the first drafts, who took the form of a cat.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' the Last Alliance of Elves and Men faced Sauron himself. He slew Elendil with his mace, and broke his sword [[Narsil]]. He would have killed Elendil's son [[Isildur]] with his hot touch, but Isildur used the shards of Narsil to cut the Ring off his hand, which caused Sauron's already ruined form to disintegrate. Sauron's Ring is claimed by Isildur, who refuses to destroy it at Mount Doom, and when he's killed by renegade Orcs, the Ring is lost to the depths of the Anduin.

In the present day, Sauron reclaimed Mordor and began reconstructing Barad-dur, and the Nazgul returned to Minas Morgul. In the ensuing years, Gandalf left to deal with Sauron (namely through joining in with the Dunedain led by Aragorn) and Saruman settled in Isengard, near Gondor, to keep an eye on Mordor. He retrieved a Palantir from Dol Guldur, but when he used it to track Sauron, he was ensnared by the Dark Lord who held the Palantir of Minas Ithil. Another user of the Palantiri to be driven mad by Sauron was Denethor, steward of Gondor. The reappearance of Sauron compelled the High Elves to begin leaving Middle-earth. He captured Gollum (who left his cave to search the Ring) and learned that the Ring was found and taken by "Baggins" to the "Shire". He sent the Nine to find it, while launching an attack on the ruined city of Osgiliath as a distraction, conquering the city before Boromir son of Denethor retrieved it. He tasked Saruman with building a second Orc army, which he would unleash against Rohan.

Meanwhile, the Ringwraiths menace the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins, but Aragorn heir of Elendil gets him to safety in Rivendell, where its decided he will take the Ring to Mount Doom and destroy it.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]],'' Sauron began calling upon the Haradrim and Easterlings who came to Mordor, and once such force was raided by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's brother. Sauron, seeking the Ring, later launched another attack on Osgiliath while Saruman besieged Helm's Deep. When the Ring (carried by Frodo and Sam) was removed from the city, he withdrew his attack. He thinks the Ring is in Gondor.

The defeat at Helm's Deep informed Sauron of the resurgence of the heir of Elendil, and troubled him with the prospect of the Free People of Middle-earth uniting against him. He decided to accelerate his plan to raze the Gondorian capital of Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, he also launched assaults against Lorien, the Woodland Realm and Dale, which were repelled.

In ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]],'' Sauron is revealed to Pippin through the Palantir captured from the defeated Saruman, thinking he is the Hobbit who has the Ring. Pippin, however, has a glimpse into Sauron's mind, alerting the others of the Dark Lord's plan to destroy Minas Tirith. The Dark Lord's forces besiege the city, but are held back by its defenders, temporarily routed by the arrival of the Rohirrim and finally defeated by Aragorn who summons the Dead Men of Dunharrow. He is then confronted by Aragorn through Denethor's Palantir, shown the reforged Narsil. His evil adversly affects Elrond's daughter Arwen, whom he shows to Aragorn, her lover, as if she were dead.

Meanwhile, Frodo the Ringbearer is captured on the borders of his land in Cirith Ungol. While he is rescued by his friend Samwise, his Orc captor, Shagrat, escapes with Frodo's Mithril Vest which he brings to Barad Dur. Sauron has him killed, but assumes that Frodo is just a spy. He sends the Vest with his messenger, The Mouth of Sauron, to dismay Gandalf with the idea that Frodo had died. His Eye nearly spots Frodo as he and Sam pass near Barad Dur, but when Aragorn slays the Mouth, it draws Sauron's attention to him instead. He contacts Aragorn psychically, but is unable to sway his mind and a battle ensues at the Black Gate.

Only when Frodo claims the Ring in the Crack of Doom does Sauron sense the Ring's presence and perceives Gandalf's plan to destroy the Ring. He sends the Nazgul to it, but it is destroyed when it falls into the lava with Gollum, and Sauron is finally defeated.

=== ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy ===
{{Blockquote|It has begun. The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise. The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.|Spoken in the [[Black Speech]], as Sauron reveals himself to Galadriel}}Sauron's role from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' is greatly expanded in Jackson's [[The Hobbit (films)|''Hobbit'' film trilogy]]. He is voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]].

After his defeat, Sauron secretly reappeared. He allied himself with [[Smaug]] and with the chiefs of the [[Gundabad Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], [[Azog]] and his son [[Bolg]]. Azog payed homage to Sauron and gave him Thror's Ring, the last of the Seven, which he captured from Thráin at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|Battle of Moria]] a hundred years prior.

Sauron released the Ringwraiths from their entombment in the [[High Fells of Rhudaur]]. With Azog as his champion, he wanted to re-establish the realm of [[Angmar]], with which he could attack the Elven realms of [[Woodland Realm|Greenwood]], [[Lothlórien|Lorien]], [[Rivendell]] and [[Lindon]], and holds the Dwarves of the [[Iron Hills]] at bay. This, he reasoned, would leave the Mannish realms of Gondor and Rohan isolated when he himself returned to Mordor.

To do so, he settled in the ruined, abandoned fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] and summoned [[Moria Orcs]] and Wargs to its cesspits. He intended to begin his plan by taking [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], expanding Angmar's domain further east and cornering the people of [[Rhovanion]]. This would also give him access to the riches of Erebor and allow him to unleash Smaug on the nearby realms. Azog, he reasoned, would be his champion, but the Orc for his part simply wanted vengeance upon [[Thorin II Oakenshield|Thorin Oakenshield]] who humiliated him in the Battle of Moria and had since gone to the [[Blue Mountains]]. The Necromancer promised him Thorin's head.

Sauron appears in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' in the form of a black, humanoid ghost, alluding to Tolkien's description of the Necromancer as a man with blackened skin. He is briefly witnessed in this form by [[Radagast]]. 

Sauron's presence cast a shadow over the world, particularly around Greenwood where Dol Guldur was positioned. The forest grew sick and dark, and the woodsmen who lived there began calling it [[Mirkwood]], and identified Sauron as The Necromancer, a human sorcerer.

Sauron bred giant Spiders of the spawn of Ungoliant (through [[Shelob]]) in the ruins of Dol Guldur, and they were spotted in Rhosgobel in the South of Mirkwood, the home of [[Radagast]] the Brown, one of the Five Wizards.

Finding this act suspicious, the Brown wizard goes to investigate Dol Guldur before he is attacked by the resurrected Witch King. Radagast averted the attack and seized the specter's dagger, the [[Morgul-knife|Morgul Blade]]. Radagast later sees the Necromancer from the shadows, but immediately leaves, barely escaping with his life from the Bats which reside in the fort, and set out to find Gandalf.

Sauron's influence extended beyond the Misty Mountains, where Trolls came down from the [[Ettenmoors]] and raided a farm on the outskirts of [[Staddle]]. This, along with spies of Azog sent to locate Thorin, aroused the suspicion of Gandalf the Grey Wizard just as Radagast came to warn him and gave him the Morgul Blade as proof. At this point, the Orc [[Yazneg]] began hunting Thorin and Company (with whom Gandalf was in train) in the name of Azog, partially out of vengeance and partially because Sauron wanted to stop them from reclaiming Erebor or slaying the dragon.

When the company arrived in Rivendell, Gandalf took his case to the White Council. [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]] were skeptical, saying that an isolated Orc attack and Troll infestation are "hardly a prelude to war", but Galadriel believed Gandalf - saying that "something moves in the shadows unseen" and that "every day it grows in strength" - and the reveal of the Morgul Blade started convincing Elrond as well.

Sauron's evil drew the Ring out of its hiding with [[Gollum]] under the Misty Mountains. It intentionally fell out of Gollum's pocket in order to be acquired by a Goblin imp who fell into his cavern, but Gollum killed the Goblin. Bilbo, a Hobbit and a member of Thorin's company, was captured by the Goblins and fell with the imp, ends up taking the Ring, which he manages to keep a secret of all but Gollum (whom he evades) and Gandalf.

In the ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'', Sauron tells Azog to stay in Dol Guldur and ready the army, and the Orc sends his son Bolg after the company in his own stead. Beorn helps keep them off of the company's back, telling Gandalf that Orcs infest the Anduin Vales and that Moria Orcs are gathering in Dol Guldur. As the company enter Mirkwood, Gandalf sees the sign of the Red Eye (being Sauron's banner) which compels him to go and investigate the High Fells which he finds open from the inside. This makes him confirm that the Necromancer cannot be mere human, and that given the Nine answer only to one master, Gandalf realizes the Necromancer is Sauron himself.

Gandalf sets for Dol Guldur, and asks Radagast to summon Galadriel. He discovered Thrain lost in Dol Guldur, as well as the hidden Orc armies in the cesspits, but is confronted by Azog and finally by Sauron himself. Gandalf is unable to save Thrain, but fends Sauron off before he is revealed in his true form and identity.

Sauron has informed Smaug of the company's approach, but when Bolg tracks the Dwarves to Laketown he sends messengers to inform Sauron that Thorin had already left for Erebor. In turn, Sauron unleashes his army which marches towards the mountain under Azog's leadership.

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', Sauron kept Gandalf imprisoned, hoping to draw the keepers of the other two Elven Rings to him. He retrieves the Morgul Blade from him, and his Orc Dungeon Keeper nearly harvests the Elven Ring of Fire from the wizard when Galadriel had come to rescue him. However, as she and an unconscious Gandalf leave, they were cornered by the Nazgul, but Elrond and Saruman were not far behind, and aided her as Radagast entered and was able to get Gandalf out.

After the Nine are defeated, Sauron appears himself, but is banished by Galadriel who appears in wrath and uses her phial. Her power is spent (and the High Elves begin their retreat from Middle-earth) but Sauron is banished to the East. Elrond suggests that he will likely return to Mordor, and tells Saruman to warn Gondor to reset their watch on the Dark Land. The Wizard reassures him that without the One Ring, Sauron will not be able to hold dominion over the land, and tells Elrond to take Galadriel back to Lothlótien and leave Sauron to him.

Meanwhile, Sauron's army (reinforced by Bolg's army of Gundabad) arrives at the mountain but is held back by armies of Dale and the Woodland Realm (which have gathered there to besiege Thorin in Erebor for the sake of earning remunerations from his hoard) and of the Iron Hills (sent to Thorin's aid). Azog risks the course of the battle to draw Thorin out, and is defeated by the dwarf. Legolas slays Bolg, while the Gundabad Army is defeated by the Great Eagles and Beorn, summoned by Radagast.

=== Video games ===

*In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', Annatar was depicted in a mural in the ruins of Tham Mírdain. He was called Antheron ("Gift Lord"), because [[Turbine]] does not have the rights to the name ''Annatar''. In the session play quest 'Daughter of Strife' from Volume I: Book XV, where the player takes on the character of Narmaleth, Sauron is also encountered in his disguise of Annatar (Antheron), at the time he taught the elves of Eregion the secrets of the Rings. Visiting Sauron's personal chambers in [[Dol Guldur]] leads to a vision of the Dark Lord, still weak and recovering from his defeat at the hand of [[Isildur]]. During an extended flashback sequence to the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Sauron himself is met within [[Barad-dur|Barad-dûr]] by the player, who controls a historic character.

*In the strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]], ''Sauron is one of the Ring Heroes, the other being Galadriel, which can be summoned when a player successfully finds Gollum and take the One Ring by killing him. He can only be summoned by the evil factions Mordor, Isengard and Goblins. Sauron is one of the strongest, if not, the strongest unit in the game, as he is very hard to kill and able to instantly kill most infantry and cavalry units with his mace. More powerful units, such as Trolls and Ents are still no match for him in small amounts, being easily killed by a few blows of his mace. Sauron is also able to summon fiery rocks from the skies and demoralize enemy units, causing them to run around in panic. When Sauron is killed, he explodes violently, heavily damaging any enemy units in the vicinity. Upon his death, he drops the One Ring, which may be picked up to summon another Ring Hero.

[[File:Shadow of Mordor - Sauron as Annatar.jpg|thumb|250px|Sauron, disguised as Annatar, with the newly-forged One Ring]]

*In the 2014 ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'' video game, Sauron appears before Celebrimbor as Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, and deceives him into creating the [[Rings of Power]]. After the secret forging of the One Ring, Annatar takes Celebrimbor to Mordor to pefect the One Ring. Celebrimbor later escapes Mordor with the Ring and uses its power to challenge Sauron into battle. At the last moment, the Ring slips from Celebrimbor's finger. As vengeance, Sauron transforms back into Annatar and proceeds to kill Celebrimbor.
*In the 2017 sequel to the above, [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War|''Middle-earth: Shadow of War'']], he ends up fighting Celebrimbor despite still being weakened by the loss of the One Ring. Despite putting up a good fight, he is overwhelmed by Celebrimbor and his new host Eltariel planning on dominating him with the power of their own New Ring. Before succumbing, he cuts off Eltariel's ring finger like Isildur had done to him years earlier, and consumed Celebrimbor's wraith. While he survives, this forces him into a new form; a burning eye at the top of [[Barad-dûr]], locked in a battle of wills with the elf until the One Ring is destroyed decades later.

*Sauron appears in both [[LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game|''LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game'']] and [[LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game|''LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game'']]; in the first he is a boss and playable character while he is featured as a playable character in the latter. His boss form appears as a massive CCBS figure-similar to something from [[LEGO]]'s ''Knights Kingdom'' line, while as a playable character he appears as a minifigure. In ''The Hobbit'' game he appears in both Necromancer and fiery armored forms. The first game also features an Annatar minifigure as a downloadable character.

*Sauron's minifigure form, voiced by Steven Blum, also appears in ''[[LEGO Dimensions]]'', where he invades [[Wikipedia:DC Comics|DC Comics]]' [[Wikipedia:Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and later engages the player in a battle atop a ''[[Wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'' [[Wikipedia:Dalek|Dalek]] flying saucer; upon defeat he is banished back to the domain of primary game antagonist Lord Vortech and does not appear again.

*In [[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|''The Lord of the Rings: Conquest'']], Sauron is a playable character.
