'''Haldir''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Lothlórien]], probably a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]], and a [[Wardens of Lórien|marchwarden]] who guarded the forest's northern borders. When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] arrived in Lórien, he became their guide to [[Caras Galadhon]]. He and his companions wore grey, hooded cloaks and resided on platforms or "[[Flet|flets]]".

Haldir was accompanied by his brothers, [[Rúmil of Lórien|Rúmil]] and [[Orophin]], who interacted little with the Fellowship because they, unlike Haldir, spoke little of the [[Westron|Common Tongue]]. Haldir could speak it fluently, as he often travelled outside of Lothlórien. Little is known about his brothers.

== Biography ==
=== Third Age ===

[[File:Haldir_of_Lorien_-_FOTR.png|thumb|left|260px|"The Dwarf breathed so loudly we could have shot him in the dark."]]

On [[January 15]], [[TA 3019|3019]], Haldir and fellow guards encountered the Fellowship near the [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]] in the eaves of the [[forest]]. Haldir was able to speak to the Fellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. He welcomed [[Legolas]] as a distant kinsman from the north (Mirkwood), and recognized [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]] as a friend to Lady [[Galadriel]]. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]. After consulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that [[Gimli]] could enter if he went blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had to go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and then led them into the forest.<ref name="Lorien"/>

They spent the night on a [[flet|''flet'']], or a platform in the trees. During the night, Haldir and his brothers heard [[Orcs]] passing and lured them away from the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange creature at the base of the tree, which [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] guessed to be [[Gollum]].

In the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use to cross the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]]. Haldir learned from [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] that the [[Grey Havens]] lay west of the [[Shire]], and he spoke longingly of the [[Seas|sea]], but sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lórien. When news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir apologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter Lórien since the time of [[Dwarves named "Durin"|Durin]].

After guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his duties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the Fellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the Silverlode, where boats awaited them.<ref name="Lorien"/>

Nothing further is known of Haldir's activities. It is likely that he participated in the defense of Lothlórien when the forces of [[Dol Guldur]] attacked it in March of 3019.

Haldir was one of the few [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lórien]] who could speak Westron. He had clearly heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had met previously.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
=== The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ===

In [[Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy|Peter Jackson's film trilogy]], Haldir was portrayed by [[Craig Parker]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]''. A [https://www.wetanz.com/shop/figures/haldir?ref=brand Weta Workshop miniature statue] of the character rendition was made by Greg Tozer later, after 2013.

[[File:Haldir at Helm's Deep.png|thumb|250px|Haldir fighting in Helm's Deep, on the Deeping Wall]]

Haldir's role is greatly expanded in the films: In ''The Fellowship of the Ring,'' he intercepts the Fellowship as they enter Lothlórien after fleeing the Mines of Moria. In ''The Two Towers'', he was sent by Elrond and led an army of five hundred elves from Lothlórien to [[Helm's Deep]]. They were stationed on the battlements and behind the [[Deeping Wall]]. They held off the [[Isengard]] assault until a bomb was set off and destroyed the walls. The Elves, on [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn's]] command, charged straight into a wall of Uruk-hai pikes.

[[File:Haldiroflorien.jpg|thumb|260px|Haldir meets his end]]

During the breaching of the walls, the Rohirrim and Elves retreated to the Keep. As Haldir directed Elves to the Keep, he was surrounded and wounded by two Uruks, and died in Aragorn's arms after slaying one of them.

==== Differences between film and novel ====

Haldir did not come to Helm's Deep at all in the novel. In Tolkien's account, there were no Elves at Helm's Deep (aside from Legolas), and the Elves of Lórien were occupied in battles against forces out of [[Khazad-dûm|Moria]] and [[Dol Guldur]], which were only mentioned in passing. Although the [[Half-elven|half-elven]] brothers [[Elladan and Elrohir]] did turn up at [[Dunharrow]], this was after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] had ended. It is also doubtful that Haldir had the authority to command such a large group since he leads only a small group of border guards.

Although Haldir dies in the battle at Helm's Deep in the film, there is no mention of his death in any of Tolkien's published works. Haldir encountered the Fellowship between [[January 15]] and [[February 16]], 3019 and it is generally believed that he lived long before and after this period and may have passed into the West with many other [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lórien]], or faded with the rest of the Elves who remained in Middle-earth.
