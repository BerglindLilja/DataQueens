'''Old Noakes''' was a [[Hobbit]] of the [[Shire]] and a resident of [[Bywater]]. He was a regular at the [[Ivy Bush]] inn in [[Hobbiton]].

== Biography ==
In [[TA 3001]], just before [[Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party]], Old Noakes was gossiping with the "[[Hamfast Gamgee|Old Gaffer]]", [[Daddy Twofoot]], and [[Sandyman]] the miller at the [[Ivy Bush]] tavern. He believed that [[Drogo Baggins]] (the father of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]) sank he and his wife [[Primula Brandybuck]]'s boat because of his weight. Sandyman thought it was because Primula pushed him off. The Old Gaffer laughed at both of these claims dismissing them as rumors.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter I: "[[A Long-expected Party (chapter)|A Long-expected Party]]"</ref>

== Etymology ==
"Old" suggests the age of this Hobbit is not young. "Noaks" is probably from the early English phrase "atten oek". This means "At the Oak". Thus fully roughly meaning "old oak".{{Fact}}
