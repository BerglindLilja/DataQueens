'''Barliman Butterbur''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] and owner of [[The Prancing Pony|''The Prancing Pony'']], in the town of [[Bree]].

==Biography==

Barliman Butterbur owned the Prancing Pony for an unknown period of time in the late [[Third Age]]. He was fond of [[Hobbit]]s and had two hobbit employees: [[Bob]], who worked in the stables, and [[Nob]], a servant. He knew [[Gandalf]] very well as he frequently came and stayed at the inn from time to time over the years. During the [[War of the Ring]], he forgot to send Gandalf's letter to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], leaving Frodo uncertain as to Gandalf's fate and causing him to start his journey much later than the letter indicated. He did not remember it until Frodo and his companions arrived to stay at the inn, and even then it was long before the connection was made.

When Gandalf found out, he threatened to "roast" Butterbur, but forgave him in light of his memory problems. Butterbur did, however, remember in time to produce [[Aragorn II Elessar|Strider]]'s credentials. Gandalf blessed his beer for seven years upon hearing that Frodo and companions were alive and well and with Strider.

After the [[War of the Ring]], Butterbur was amazed to learn that Strider, a former patron of his inn and for whom he thought was a mere [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] of the wild, had become a [[King of the Reunited Kingdom|king]]. In the days that the hobbits visited The Prancing Pony shortly before the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Bob went home after dark every day, which Butterbur continued to forget.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter IX: "[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]"</ref><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' Book One, Chapter X: "[[Strider (chapter)|Strider]]"</ref>
