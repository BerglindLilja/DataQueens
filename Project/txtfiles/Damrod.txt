== Biography ==

Damrod led the night patrol that captured [[Gollum]] in the [[Forbidden Pool]]. He also fought in the battle for [[Osgiliath]]. Damrod retreated to [[Minas Tirith]] with all the surviving defenders. A few days later, Damrod was sent with [[Faramir]] to defend [[Osgiliath]] from the enemy's assault. Damrod was among the dead; it is said his body was never recovered due to the overwhelming [[Orc]] invasion of [[Gondor]]. Damrod had little hope, for he believed "the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of [[Minas Tirith]] are doomed."<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Two Towers (novel)|The Two Towers]],'' Book Four, Chapter IV: "[[Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit]]"</ref><br />

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' Mablung and Damrod are first met in [[Osgiliath]] culverts, hiding from the enemy forces above. Having been separated from [[Faramir]], they are unaware of his fate and send the player looking for sings of him throughout the overrun city. While some of those hiding eventually make a break for [[Minas Tirith]] (the player among them), Mablung and Damrod stay behind along with some other Rangers and spend the siege of the White City hiding under the enemy's feet. After the the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] they are finally able to come out and join the Host of the West on the march towards the [[Black Gate]]. Upon entering the Wastes of [[Morannon]], Damrod is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by [[Aragorn]] and now commanded by Lord [[Duinhir]] towards [[Cair Andros]] through [[Ithilien]] wilderness. After King [[Elessar]] charges Steward [[Faramir]] with cleansing the evil of [[Minas Morgul]] and the [[Morgul Vale]], Damrod joins other Rangers in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Rangers inside [[Minas Morgul]] itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.
