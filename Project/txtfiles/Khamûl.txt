'''Khamûl''' was one of the nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] second to the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-king]], in [[Middle-earth]]. During the [[Third Age]], he held [[Dol Guldur]] as [[Sauron]]'s lieutenant. After the Witch-king was slain, he became the Lord of Nazgûl for a short period.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Three: The Third Age, IV: "The Nazgûl Hunt for the Ring"</ref>

== Biography ==
=== Second Age ===

[[File:John Howe - Khamul the Easterling.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Khamûl the Easterling, by [[John Howe]]]]

Khamûl was once a mortal man, an [[Easterlings|Easterling]] who ruled in [[Rhûn]]. He received one of the nine [[Ring of Power|Rings of Power]] from the [[Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]] and in time he was corrupted and became one of his servants.

He first appeared as one of the Nazgûl in [[SA 2251]].<ref name=years>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]]: The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands), "The Great Years"</ref>

=== Third Age ===
[[File:Denis Gordeev- Khamul in the Shire.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Khamûl in the Shire, by Denis Gordeev]]

In [[TA 2951]], Sauron sent three Nazgûl to abide in [[Dol Guldur]], and Khamûl commanded the fortress thereafter.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Introduction, Part Three, IV: "The Hunt for the Ring"</ref><ref name="notes">''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Three: The Third Age, chapter IV: "[[The Hunt for the Ring]]", Notes</ref><ref name=years/>

==== War of the Ring ====

Khamûl was the wraith who pursued the hobbits to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the [[Shire]], and who asked [[Farmer Maggot]] for "Baggins" just before [[Frodo Baggins]] left [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=shortcut>''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book One, Chapter IV: "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]"</ref>

Khamûl also appeared in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] with the other Nazgûl, mounted on his [[Fell beast|Fellbeast]] and killing [[Gondor]]'s soldiers at the beginning of the battle. After the Witch-king´s demise, he and the other seven lesser Nazgûl retreated to Mordor.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Book Five, Chapter VI: "[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]"</ref>

Afterwards, Khamûl became the leader of the Nazgûl. He led them to the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] riding his Fellbeast, before they were attacked by the [[Great Eagles|Eagles]]. The Nazgûl retreated when Sauron sensed that Frodo claimed the [[One Ring]] for himself, and were dispatched to [[Mount Doom]]. He fell in the eruption's fire.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Book Six, Chapter III: "[[Mount Doom (chapter)|Mount Doom]]"</ref>

== Names ==
Khamûl was called the '''Shadow of the East''', the '''Second Chief''', and '''the Black Easterling'''.<ref name=notes/> He was the only Ringwraith whose name was given by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as well as one of the six Ringwraiths not of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent.
== Earlier versions of the legendarium ==
In prior versions of the [[legendarium]], Khamûl was stationed at Dol Guldur on [[March 6]], when [[Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn]] revealed himself to Sauron and began marching on the Wood-elf realms on March 10th. On March 11th, his forces began assailing the nearby [[Lothlórien]]. After this failed, much of his force passed around the border of the woods and entered the [[The Wold|Wold]] of [[Rohan]]. On [[March 12]], they were met with [[Ents]] sent east from [[Fangorn]] and [[Isengard]], and were routed. Lórien was then attacked twice more on [[March 15]] and [[March 22]], but was never entered. The forces of Dol Guldur also went north into [[Mirkwood]], battling the forces of King [[Thranduil]] under Mirkwood's trees, the climax of these [[Battle Under the Trees|battles]] being on March 15,  which after a "long battle... and great ruin and fire" was won by Thranduil's forces.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== Peter Jackson's film trilogy ===

[[File:Khamul's_true_apperance..jpg|thumb|left|170px|The model for Khamûl's true appearance]]
[[File:NineMen2.jpg|thumb|Khamûl before he was corrupted, according to [[Mordor ~ The Land of Shadow|TheLandOfShadow.com]]]]

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, Khamûl was shown briefly when speaking to [[Farmer Maggot]], who directs him onward to [[Hobbiton]]. Later, the Hobbits evade Farmer Maggot, but Frodo senses a presence and tells his friends to get off the road. Hiding behind a tree, the Hobbits hushed as Khamûl approached, catching their scent. As the four stayed quiet, Merry throws a sack of vegetables behind the Rider's horse, alarming Khamûl and causing him to leave the Hobbits undetected.

In ''[[The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'', after the ring was destroyed, Khamûl died along with the seven other Ringwraiths in the eruption of [[Mount Doom]], the Witch-king having perished earlier during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

=== The Hobbit film trilogy ===
[[File:Khamul the Easterling.png|alt=|thumb|170x170px|Khamûl, as seen in ''The Hobbit'' films]]
In the ''[[The Hobbit (films)|The Hobbit]]'' [[The Hobbit (films)|films]], the nine Ringwraiths had been buried in the [[High Fells of Rhudaur]], but emerged at the summons of the Necromancer, who is revealed to be [[Sauron]]. In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', Khamûl and the other eight [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] engage the [[White Council]] in battle, with Khamûl wearing spectral [[Easterling]] armor.

=== Video games ===

*Though not named in the game, Khamûl was featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' as the Lieutenant of [[Dol Guldur]]. He commands the forces of Sauron in Mirkwood and was the final boss of the 12-person raid on Barad Guldur, along with his fellbeast. He was once known as '''The Cursed Rider''', as one of the Nine Nazgûl, he was the recipient of Orôm (Warmonger), one of the nine Rings of Power that were forged for Men. He was an Easterling King, but his name is lost in time, and he is now known by the most common of his many nicknames.

*In [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[Rise of the Witch-king|The Battle for Middle-earth]]''[[Rise of the Witch-king| ''II: The Rise of the Witch-king'']], Khamûl is one of two named Ringwraith heroes of the Mordor faction who ride on fellbeasts.
