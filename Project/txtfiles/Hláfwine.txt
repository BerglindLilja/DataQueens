During the [[War of the Ring]], Hláfwine took refuge in the [[Hornburg]] along with many others. He was rather plump, and his job was selling potatoes and eggs to the [[Rohirrim|people of]] Rohan. Later, he was among those that were forced to fight and defend the [[Hornburg]] from an [[Saruman's army|army]] of 10,000 [[Uruk-hai]] that were dispatched by [[Saruman]] to march towards Helm's Deep. His fate is unknown.
